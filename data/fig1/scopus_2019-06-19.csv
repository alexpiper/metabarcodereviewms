Leptospires, which cause the zoonotic disease leptospirosis, persist in soil and aqueous environments. Several factors, including rainfall, the presence of reservoir animals, and various abiotic and biotic components interact to influence leptospiral survival, persistence, and pathogenicity in the environment. However, how these factors modulate the risk of infection is poorly understood. Here we developed an approach using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding for detecting the microbiome, vertebrates, and pathogenic Leptospira in aquatic samples. Specifically, we combined 4 sets of primers to generate PCR products for high-throughput sequencing of multiple amplicons through next-generation sequencing. Using our method to analyze the eDNA of leptospirosis-endemic areas in northern Okinawa, Japan, we found that the microbiota in each river shifted over time. Operating taxonomic units corresponding to pathogenic L. alstonii, L. kmetyi, and L. interrogans were detected in association with 12 nonpathogenic bacterial species. In addition, the frequencies of 11 of these species correlated with the amount of rainfall. Furthermore, 10 vertebrate species, including Sus scrofa, Pteropus dasymallus, and Cynops ensicauda, showed high correlation with leptospiral eDNA detection. Our eDNA metabarcoding method is a powerful tool for understanding the environmental phase of Leptospira and predicting human infection risk.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"21100200805","JP18H02655","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","1","TRUE","2","9","1","31024059","6575",NA,NA,2019

The characterization of biodiversity is a crucial element of ecological investigations as well as environmental assessment and monitoring activities. Increasingly, amplicon-based environmental DNA metabarcoding (alternatively, marker gene metagenomics) is used for such studies given its ability to provide biodiversity data from various groups of organisms simply from analysis of bulk environmental samples such as water, soil or sediments. The Illumina MiSeq is currently the most popular tool for carrying out this work, but we set out to determine whether typical studies were reading enough DNA to detect rare organisms (i.e., those that may be of greatest interest such as endangered or invasive species) present in the environment. We collected sea water samples along two transects in Conception Bay, Newfoundland and analyzed them on the MiSeq with a sequencing depth of 100,000 reads per sample (exceeding the 60,000 per sample that is typical of similar studies). We then analyzed these same samples on Illumina’s newest high-capacity platform, the NovaSeq, at a depth of 7 million reads per sample. Not surprisingly, the NovaSeq detected many more taxa than the MiSeq thanks to its much greater sequencing depth. However, contrary to our expectations this pattern was true even in depth-for-depth comparisons. In other words, the NovaSeq can detect more DNA sequence diversity within samples than the MiSeq, even at the exact same sequencing depth. Even when samples were reanalyzed on the MiSeq with a sequencing depth of 1 million reads each, the MiSeq’s ability to detect new sequences plateaued while the NovaSeq continued to detect new sequence variants. These results have important biological implications. The NovaSeq found 40% more metazoan families in this environment than the MiSeq, including some of interest such as marine mammals and bony fish so the real-world implications of these findings are significant. These results are most likely associated to the advances incorporated in the NovaSeq, especially a patterned flow cell, which prevents similar sequences that are neighbours on the flow cell (common in metabarcoding studies) from being erroneously merged into single spots by the sequencing instrument. This study sets the stage for incorporating eDNA metabarcoding in comprehensive analysis of oceanic samples in a wide range of ecological and environmental investigations.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"21100200805","781-37749-207993","Petroleum Research Newfoundland &amp; Labrador","1","TRUE","3","9","1","30979963","5991",NA,NA,2019

Forest decline is nowadays a major challenge for ecosystem sustainability. Dehesas, which consists of savannah-like mediterranean ecosystems, are threatened by the holm oak decline in the south-west of Iberian Peninsula. Phytophthora cinnamomi is considered the main agent of holm oak root rot, but little is known about the relationship between diversity of soilborne microbial community and the decline syndrome of holm oak. It would be hypothesized that the changes in the structure and functionality of the soil microbiome might influence tree health status through changes in richness and diversity of beneficial organisms such as mycorrhizal species, or fungal plant pathogens such as Fusarium spp. or Alternaria spp. Total DNA of soil samples from declined oak dehesas was extracted and analyzed through metabarcoding techniques, to evaluate the specific composition and diversity of the fungal and oomycete communities and their relationship with the disease symptoms. The fungal community included a wide range of pathogens and abundance of ectomycorrhizal key taxa related with low defoliation degree. Phytophthora cinnamomi and Pythium spiculum did not appear among the most abundant oomycetes, nor were they related directly to defoliation levels. Moreover, a particular taxon belonging to the genus Trichoderma was strongly correlated with the scarcity of pathogenic Phytophthora spp. The diversity and composition of fungal and oomycete communities were related to the severity of the decline symptoms.

Mamiellophyceae (unicellular green algae) are a key phytoplankton group in coastal waters.

Mamiellophyceae were found at nearly all OSD stations and represented 55% of the green microalgae (Chlorophyta) reads.

These analyses uncovered novel diversity within each genus except Bathycoccus. In Ostreococcus, a new clade (E) was the second most represented clade after Ostreococcus “lucimarinus”. Micromonas could be separated into nine clades, exceeding the six species and candidate species already described. Finally, we found two new environmental clades within Mantoniella.

An accurate estimation of parasitism rates and diversity of parasitoids of crop insect pests is a prerequisite for exploring processes leading to efficient natural biocontrol. Traditional methods such as rearing have been often limited by taxonomic identification, insect mortality and intensive work, but the advent of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques, such as DNA metabarcoding, is increasingly seen as a reliable and powerful alternative approach. Little has been done to explore the benefits of such an approach for estimating parasitism rates and parasitoid diversity in an agricultural context. In this study, we compared the composition of parasitoid species and parasitism rates between rearing and DNA metabarcoding of host eggs and larvae of the millet head miner, Heliocheilus albipunctella De Joannis (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae), collected from millet fields in Senegal. We first assessed the detection threshold for the main ten endoparasitoids, by sequencing PCR products obtained from artificial dilution gradients of the parasitoid DNAs in the host moth. We then assessed the potential of DNA metabarcoding for diagnosing parasitism rates in samples collected from the field. Under controlled conditions, our results showed that relatively small quantities of parasitoid DNA (0.07 ng) were successfully detected within an eight-fold larger quantity of host DNA. Parasitoid diversity and parasitism rate estimates were always higher for DNA metabarcoding than for host rearing. Furthermore, metabarcoding detected multi-parasitism, cryptic parasitoid species and differences in parasitism rates between two different sampling sites. Metabarcoding shows promise for gaining a clearer understanding of the importance and complexity of host-parasitoid interactions in agro-ecosystems, with a view to improving pest biocontrol strategies.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","9",NA,"21100200805","undefined","Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement","1","TRUE","6","9","1","30842584","3646",NA,NA,2019

Twenty-four zooplankton community samples were collected from three regions throughout the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, over two temperature regimes (warm and cool seasons), as well as 20 samples of opportunistically collected Bryde’s whale scat. Multi-locus DNA barcode libraries were constructed from 18S and COI gene fragments, representing a trade-off between identification and resolution of metazoan taxa. Zooplankton community OTU occurrence and relative read abundance showed regional and seasonal differences based on permutational analyses of variance in both DNA barcodes, with significant changes in biodiversity indices linked to season in COI only. In contrast, we did not find evidence that Bryde’s whale diet shows seasonal or regional trends, but instead indicated clear prey preferences for krill-like crustaceans, copepods, salps and ray-finned fishes independent of prey availability.

Melojo oak (Quercus pyrenaica Willd.) is a key tree species of Mediterranean forests; however, these forests show an advanced stage of deterioration in the Iberian Peninsula. Plant-associated microorganisms play an essential role improving their host’s fitness, hence, a better understanding of oak rhizospheric microbiome, especially of those active members, could be the first step towards microbiome-based approaches for oak-forest improvement. Here we reported, for the first time, the diversity of total (DNA-based) and potentially active (RNA-based) bacterial communities of different melojo-oak forest formations through pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. We found that potentially active bacterial communities were as rich and diverse as total bacterial communities, but different in terms of relative abundance patterns in some of the studied areas. Both core microbiomes were dominated by a relatively small percentage of OTUs, most of which showed positive correlation between both libraries. However, the uncoupling between abundance (rDNA) and potential activity (rRNA) for some taxa suggests that the most abundant taxa are not always the most active, and that low-abundance OTUs may have a strong influence on oak’s rhizospheric ecology. Thus, measurement of rRNA:rDNA ratio could be helpful in identifying major players for the development of bacterial bioinoculants.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"21100200805","20134R069-RECUPERA 2020","Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas","1","TRUE","9","9","1","30737434","1695",NA,NA,2019

We studied tropical rainforest fragments and derived rubber plantations at a network of sites in Xishuangbanna, China, hypothesizing a major decrease in diversity with conversion to plantations. We used metabarcoding of the 18S rRNA gene and recovered 2313 OTUs, with a total of 449 OTUs shared between the two land-use types. The most abundant phyla detected were Annelida (66.4% reads) followed by arthropods (15.5% reads) and nematodes (8.9% reads). Of these, only annelids were significantly more abundant in rubber plantation. Taken together, a- and ß-diversity were significantly higher in forest than rubber plantation. Soil pH and spatial distance explained a significant portion of the variability in phylogenetic community structure for both land-use types.

Here, a national-scale metabarcoding analysis of 436 locations across 7 different temperate ecosystems shows that belowground animal and microbial (bacteria, archaea, fungi, and protists) richness follow divergent trends, whereas ß-diversity does not. Animal richness is governed by intensive land use and unaffected by soil properties, while microbial richness was driven by environmental properties across land uses.

Many affected ecosystems are located within the Mediterranean basin, where cork oak (Quercus suber L.) is one of the most important forest ecosystems. Despite cork oak tolerance to drought, the decrease of water availability and increase of temperature is causing a serious decline of cork oak populations. In the present work, the bacterial community of cork oak soils was assessed by metabarcoding using Illumina Miseq. Soils from seven independent cork oak forests were collected along a climate gradient. In all forest soils, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the richest and more abundant bacteria. Acidobacteria also presented a high relative abundance, and Chloroflexi was a rich phylum. The soil bacterial community diversity and composition was strongly affected by the climatic region where cork oak resides and specific bacterial taxa were differently affected by precipitation and temperature. Accordingly, cork oak bacterial communities clustered into three distinct groups, related with humid, sub-humid and arid/semi-arid climates. Driest and warmer forests presented more diverse bacterial communities than humid and coolest forests. However, driest climates presented more homogenous bacterial communities among forests than humid climates. Climate (mainly precipitation) revealed to be the strongest driver leading to significant variations of bacterial community profiles. The most impacted bacterial taxa by climatic variables were Proteobacteria, in particular Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. Humid forests presented mainly Acidobacteria as good indicators of climate, whereas Actinobacteria members were better indicators for arid forests (mainly Gaiellales and Frankiales). Some indicator species for different climate conditions were members of the bacterial core of cork oak stands (7% of the total bacterial community). Taken together, different microbiomes were selected by the climate conditions in cork oak stands along a climate gradient and might provide the key to forest sustainability in times of global warming.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Bacterial communities | Climate | Cork oak | Forest soils","96119","PEst-OE/BIA/UI4046/2014","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","0","FALSE","16","143",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0929139318313994",2019

The bioinformatics analysis showed that salt samples (marine and spring) had the highest biodiversity indexes, followed by the aromatic herbs (thyme, oregano, and fennel) and finally by fermented dressing samples (garlic, pepper, and pepper paste). In salt samples, a significant high presence of Cytophagia, Sphingobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Halobacteria classes was observed. On the contrary, the presence of Bacilli class in fermented dressing samples was significantly higher compared to the other samples. Finally, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was statistically higher in the samples of herbs. At genus or family taxonomic level, Pseudomonas and diverse non-assigned genus of the Enterobacteriaceae family predominated in many samples of herbs. In fermented dressing samples, a diverse genus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family appeared in a high relative abundance in pepper paste and garlic, and the presence of Vibrio sp. was detected in pepper. However, Lactobacillus, Weisella, and Pediococcus were the predominant genera found in many of these fermented samples. Salinibacter was the most representative genus in both types of salt samples. Multivariate analysis (PCA) of the metataxonomic data sets discriminated well the samples belonging to the three different groups, showing a high proportion of sequences shared by samples-group.

While biodiversity measured by morphology and by DNA often has been found correlated, few studies have compared DNA data to established measures of impairment such as multimetric pollution tolerance indices used by many bioassessment programs. We incorporated environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of seston into a rigorous watershed-scale biological assessment of an urban stream to examine the extent to which eDNA richness and diversity patterns were correlated with multimetric indices and ecological impairment status designations. We also evaluated different filtering approaches and taxonomic classifications to identify best practices for environmental assessments. Seston eDNA revealed a wide diversity of eukaryotic taxa but was dominated by diatoms (36%). Differentiation among sites in alpha and beta diversity was greater when operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were classified taxonomically, but coarse resolution taxonomy (kingdom) was more informative than finer resolution taxonomy (family, genus). Correlations of DNA richness and diversity with multimetric indices for fish and macroinvertebrates were generally weak, possibly because Metazoa were not highly represented in our DNA dataset. Nonetheless, sites could be differentiated based on ecological impairment status, with more impaired sites having lower eDNA diversity as measured by the Shannon index, but higher taxonomic richness. Significant environmental drivers of community structure, as inferred from constrained ordination analyses, differed among kingdoms within the eDNA dataset, as well as from fish and macrobenthos, suggesting that eDNA provides novel environmental information. These results suggest that even a simple seston eDNA filtering protocol can provide biodiversity information of value to stream bioassessment programs.

For aquatic ecosystems in Europe, reliable barcode reference libraries are particularly important if molecular identification tools are to be implemented in biomonitoring and reports in the context of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD)and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). We analysed gaps in the two most important reference databases, Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD)and NCBI GenBank, with a focus on the taxa most frequently used in WFD and MSFD. Our analyses show that coverage varies strongly among taxonomic groups, and among geographic regions. In general, groups that were actively targeted in barcode projects (e.g. fish, true bugs, caddisflies and vascular plants)are well represented in the barcode libraries, while others have fewer records (e.g. marine molluscs, ascidians, and freshwater diatoms). We also found that species monitored in several countries often are represented by barcodes in reference libraries, while species monitored in a single country frequently lack sequence records. A large proportion of species (up to 50%)in several taxonomic groups are only represented by private data in BOLD. Our results have implications for the future strategy to fill existing gaps in barcode libraries, especially if DNA metabarcoding is to be used in the monitoring of European aquatic biota under the WFD and MSFD. For example, missing species relevant to monitoring in multiple countries should be prioritized for future collaborative programs. We also discuss why a strategy for quality control and quality assurance of barcode reference libraries is needed and recommend future steps to ensure full utilisation of metabarcoding in aquatic biomonitoring.","0","Journal","re","Review","100","41","Biological monitoring | DNA barcoding | Freshwater | Marine | Quality assurance | Reference library","25349","BR","Fundação Portugal Telecom","1","TRUE","20","678",NA,"31077928",NA,NA,"S0048969719317760",2019

At 96 h, significant discolouration of corals was only observed in 470 and 900 µg Ni/L treatments, the highest concentrations tested. While high concentrations of nickel caused bleaching, no changes in the composition of their microbiome communities were observed. In contrast, exposure to copper not only resulted in bleaching, but altered the composition of both the eukaryote and bacterial communities of the coral's microbiomes. Our findings showed that these effects were only evident at relatively high concentrations of nickel and copper, reflecting concentrations observed only in extremely polluted environments.

Specific areas highlighted include the range of NGS platforms and sequence databases available, validation of NGS, and limitations and appropriate uses of these technologies. Many NGS platforms are available, with different properties (such as sequence read length and output) suited to different analyses. Despite this wealth of options, more platforms are being brought out frequently, and advances such as reduced error rate will enable their expanded use for food authenticity. This rapid expansion in the use of DNA sequencing has led to an equally rapid enlargement in sequence databases, and the construction of contemporaneous, authenticated databases may be a useful innovation for the application of NGS to authenticity. Such applications will require robust quality control criteria and proficiency testing schemes, both of which are being developed.

In trying to circumvent the many challenges associated with water filtration and DNA isolation from environmental samples, significant investment is being made in high-tech solutions, such as automated underwater vehicles and robots [2].

We obtained sponge samples from Mediterranean and Antarctic surveys, extracted total DNA from their tissues, and obtained tens of thousands of fish DNA reads via metabarcoding, which were able to clearly distinguish samples from the two regions. One Antarctic sample yielded hundreds of reads from chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii).

We compared diversity metrics and assessed both approaches’ ability to evaluate the relationship between macroinvertebrate community and environmental variables. In total, we morphologically identified 45 taxa (3 families, six subfamilies, 31 genera, and five species) from 8,276 collected individuals from ten study sites. We detected 44 species by metabarcoding, with 35 species collapsed into 11 groups matching the morphologically identified taxa. A significant positive correlation between logged depth (number of HTS reads) and abundance of morphological taxa was observed, which implied that quantitative data could be used for subsequent analyses. We recovered a considerably high rate of relative abundance detection of the morphologically identified samples. Recovery of samples by incidence or presence/absence count were considerably low, with a high rate of false-negative detection specifically for species with scarce representation in the community sample. Given the low taxonomic resolution of the morphological assignment in this study, we report that metabarcoding does not reflect the majority of the species naturally occurring in our site, which could further be proven by performing refined morphological assessment of the samples. However, abundance-based detection proved to be efficient with 92% of the individuals correctly demonstrated.

The two approaches demonstrated substantial congruence in the detection of taxa (81% and 69% at the family and genus level, respectively) and in the characterization of community composition and richness. However, DNA metabarcoding from preservative ethanol identified significantly fewer genera (3.3 on average, 15.9%) and families (2.0, 11.5%) than conventional morphometrics. Taxa missed by metabarcoding of storage ethanol were typically those low in proportional mass or poorly represented in the CO1 reference database. This led to some differences in the explanatory variables identified as being related to macroinvertebrate metrics, which could have implications on conclusions and management actions that might result therefrom. For example, the negative relationships between richness and reach-scale variables associated with forest management intensity were weaker when richness was based on metabarcoding as compared to conventional morphometrics. Discriminatory power was greater when data at the genus level were used. The congruence between functional feeding group results derived from morphometric (based on relative abundance) vs. metabarcoding (based on relative frequency and read abundance) identifications was group specific (r = 0.16–0.63), but low overall.

We compared the barcodes and biodiversity estimates from this data set with those from a parallel DNA metabarcoding analysis of soil from the same locations, and with pre-existing sequences in reference databases, before exploring the use of combined data sets as a basis for estimating total invertebrate biodiversity. We obtained 1,282 28S and 1,610 COI barcodes from a total of 1,947 invertebrate specimens, which were clustered into 247 (28S) and 366 (COI) OTUs, of which = 10% were represented in GenBank.

A DNA metabarcoding analysis of soil DNA from the same sites resulted in the identification of similar numbers of OTUs in most invertebrate groups compared with the DNA barcoding, but less than 10% of the DNA barcoding COI OTUs were also detected by the metabarcoding analysis of soil DNA. A mark–recapture analysis based on the overlap between these data sets estimated the presence of approximately 6,800 arthropod species (excluding mites) on the island, including ~3,900 insects. Estimates of New Zealand-wide biodiversity for selected arthropod groups based on matching of the COI DNA barcodes with pre-existing reference sequences suggested over 13,200 insect species are present, including 4,000 Coleoptera, 2,200 Diptera, and 2,700 Hymenoptera species, and 1,000 arachnid species (excluding mites). These results confirm that metabarcoding analyses of soil DNA tends to recover different components of terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity compared to traditional invertebrate sampling, but the combined methods provide a novel basis for estimating invertebrate biodiversity.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","28S | biodiversity estimation | COI | Hauturu | leaf litter | Little Barrier Island | New Zealand | OTUs | soil","20287","undefined","University of Auckland","0","FALSE","29","29","4",NA,"e01877",NA,NA,2019

We performed random forest regression analyses with 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data and environmental data to determine which putative ecological drivers best explained spatiotemporal variation in total microcystin and several individual congeners in a eutrophic freshwater reservoir. Model performance was best for predicting concentrations of the congener MC-LR, with ca. 88% of spatiotemporal variance explained. Most of the variance was associated with changes in the relative abundance of the cyanobacterial genus Microcystis.

Deforestation has a substantial impact on aboveground biodiversity, but the response of belowground soil fungi remains poorly understood. In a tropical montane rainforest in southwestern China, plots were established along a forest degradation gradient ranging from mature and regenerated forests to open land to examine the impacts of forest degradation and deforestation on ecosystem diversity and function. Here, we evaluated the changes in belowground fungal diversity and community composition using a metabarcoding approach. Soil saprotrophic fungal richness declined with increasing forest disturbance. For example, Penicillium spp. (phosphorus [P]-solubilizing fungi) dominated in mature forest but were less abundant in regenerating forests and showed the lowest abundance in open land sites. Conversely, the abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi increased along the disturbance gradient. The decline in soil saprophytic fungi may be a direct result of forest disturbance or it may be associated with increased availability of soil phosphorus indirectly through an increase in soil pH. The increase in abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi may be related to reduced competition with saprotrophic fungi, changes in microclimate, or increased spore rain. These results demonstrate a loss of dominant P-solubilizing saprotrophic fungi along the disturbance gradient, indicating a change from soil P limitation in mature tropical forests to soil C limitation in deforested sites. The increased prevalence of pathogenic fungi may inhibit plant succession following deforestation. Overall, this research demonstrates that soil fungi can be used as a sensitive indicator for soil health to evaluate the consequences of forest disturbance.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Forest disturbance | Fungal functional groups | Illumina sequencing | P extraction | Soil health | Tropical forest","19618","31470546","Chinese Academy of Sciences","0","FALSE","34","85","12",NA,"e00080-19","CAS",NA,2019

It is unclear what attracts the birds to this area, especially as the food composition of seabirds outside the breeding season is notoriously difficult to study. To obtain information on prey species composition of red-throated divers in this area, faecal samples from 34 birds caught alive were analysed using DNA metabarcoding. Prey DNA was detected in 85% of the samples with a mean number of 4.2 ± 0.7 taxa per sample (n = 29). Altogether, we found a broad prey spectrum with 19 fish taxa from 13 families dominated by five groups: clupeids, mackerel, gadoids, flatfish and sand lances with clupeids being the most frequently detected prey. Our results indicate that red-throated divers are generalist opportunistic feeders in the German Bight, but pelagic schooling fish that aggregate at frontal zones and have a high energetic value might be favoured. Atlantic mackerel appears to be a more important prey for red-throated divers in this area than previously thought. The precision achievable using metabarcoding has revealed a number of prey species that are consumed by red-throated divers in the German Bight, which helps to explain the selection of this area by divers in winter and spring.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","11",NA,"12165","NBAF989","University of Sheffield","0","FALSE","35","166","6",NA,"77",NA,NA,2019

Ciliate sequences dominated both, microbial mats and plankton, followed by either Stramenopiles or excavates. Stramenopiles were more prominent in microbial mats, whereas jakobids dominated the plankton fraction of the oxygen-depleted water column. Mats cultured in the laboratory were enriched in Cercozoa.

I carried out DNA metabarcoding of fungi from soil samples taken in a selected study area of Pannonian forests in northern Hungary to compare richness and community composition of taxonomic and functional groups of fungi between slopes of predominantly southerly vs. northerly aspect. The deep sequence data presented here (i.e. 980 766 quality-filtered sequences) indicate that both niche (environmental filtering) and neutral (stochastic) processes shape fungal community composition at landscape level. Fungal community composition correlated strongly with aspect, with many fungi showing preference for either south-facing or north-facing slopes. Several taxonomic and functional groups showed significant differences in richness between north- and south-facing slopes and strong compositional differences were observed in all functional groups. The effect of aspect on fungal communities likely is mediated through contrasting mesoclimatic conditions, that in turn influence edaphic processes as well as vegetation. The compositional differences observed in fungi are largely consistent with the coenologically described forest types, which indicates the usefulness of these habitat types as a framework to better understand environmental differences that influence fungal community composition at landscape level.

Background: Ticks are obligate blood feeders transmitting major pathogens worldwide. Over the past few years, considerable research efforts have focused on the diversity, distribution and impact of gut and intracellular bacterial symbionts on tick development and tick-borne pathogen transmission. The study of this internal microbiome requires the use of a sterilization method to remove external (i.e. cuticular) microbes present on the tick's surface and to avoid any further contamination. Several sterilization methods exist, including ethanol- or bleach-based treatments that are both effective in killing microbes but with different potential effects on DNA denaturation. Methods: We examined how these different sterilization methods impact the measure of internal microbial diversity hosted by the Cayenne tick Amblyomma cajennense (sensu stricto). Bacterial barcoding investigations based on 16S rRNA gene sequences were conducted on two batches of 50 individuals each: Ticks of the first batch were sterilized with bleach diluted at 1% and the second batch with 70% ethanol. Tick external microbiome was also determined from cuticle smearing and water samples used for tick washing. Results: Bacterial barcoding investigations showed major differences between ethanol- and bleach-treated specimens. Both methods led to the detection of major intracellular bacteria associated with A. cajennense (s.s.) but ethanol-treated ticks always harbored a higher bacterial diversity than bleach-treated ticks. Further examinations of tick gut and tick external microbiome revealed that ethanol-based surface sterilization method is inefficient to eliminate the DNA of external bacteria. Conclusions: We herein provide evidence that studies investigating the internal microbiome of ticks should consider bleach as the gold standard to efficiently remove cuticular bacterial DNA. Indeed, this method does not impact the internal bacterial diversity hosted by ticks and is thus a better method than the ethanol-based one for studying the internal microbiome.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","16S rRNA | Amblyomma | B. | Bacteriala | communities | Metabarcoding | Tickmicrobiome","17500154721","2016–2018","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","1","TRUE","41","12","1",NA,"268",NA,NA,2019

Exposure of terrestrial mammals to chemical contaminants like trace metals (TMs) is considered to be mainly based on trophic transfer. Although relationships between TM transfer to animals and identity of contaminated food have been studied, the variation of the TM transfer with respect to diet diversity has been poorly documented. In this study, the oral exposure to TMs of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus was investigated with respect to both the number of different items, i.e., diet richness, and the identity of items determined by metabarcoding from their stomach content, i.e., diet composition. The results showed that consuming Salicaceae, a known cadmium accumulator plant family, significantly increased exposure to cadmium and zinc. However, an increase in diet richness minimized exposure to cadmium when mice consumed Salicaceae items. This strongly suggests that TM accumulator items can lead to a high oral exposure to TMs but that such high exposure due to TM accumulator items can be ""diluted"" by diet richness due to other low accumulator items. Our results clearly indicate that both the presence of certain items in the diet and diet richness are important determinants of exposure to TMs in generalist animals, which matches the predictions of the ""diet dilution hypothesis"".","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"21537","2015C-06107","Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite","0","FALSE","42","53","10","31002242",NA,NA,NA,2019

Our results point at MC-producing P. agardhii and ATX-producing C. issatschenkoi as the main contributors to the moderate toxin concentrations observed, and suggest that their distribution in Southern Europe is broader than previously thought. Our findings also stress the need for monitoring low-abundance cyanobacteria (<1% relative abundance) in cyanotoxicity studies, and provide novel data on the presence of picocyanobacteria and potentially ATX-producing benthic taxa (e.g., Phormidium) in deep thermally-stratified water bodies.

Crop residues are a crucial ecological niche with a major biological impact on agricultural ecosystems. In this study, we used a combined diachronic and synchronic field experiment based on wheat-oilseed rape rotations to test the hypothesis that plant is a structuring factor of microbial communities in crop residues, and that this effect decreases over time with their likely progressive degradation and colonisation by other microorganisms. We characterised an entire fungal and bacterial community associated with 150 wheat and oilseed rape residue samples at a plurennial scale by metabarcoding. The impact of plant species on the residue microbiota decreased over time and our data revealed turnover, with the replacement of oligotrophs, often plant-specific genera (such as pathogens) by copiotrophs, belonging to more generalist genera. Within a single cropping season, the plant-specific genera and species were gradually replaced by taxa that are likely to originate from the soil. These changes occurred more rapidly for bacteria than for fungi, known to degrade complex compounds. Overall, our findings suggest that crop residues constitute a key fully-fledged microbial ecosystem. Taking into account this ecosystem, that has been neglected for too long, is essential, not only to improve the quantitative management of residues, the presence of which can be detrimental to crop health, but also to identify groups of beneficial microorganisms. Our findings are of particular importance, because the wheat-oilseed rape rotation, in which no-till practices are frequent, is particularly widespread in the European arable cropping systems.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Community succession | Microbial diversity | Oilseed rape | Residue microbiota | Wheat","20266","UMR IGEPP","Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique","0","FALSE","45","77","4","30834960",NA,NA,NA,2019

Recent studies have shown that environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is an effective and non-invasive method, which can provide semi-quantitative information about fish communities in large lakes. This study further investigated the potential of fish-based eDNA metabarcoding as a tool for lake assessment by collecting and analysing water samples from eight Welsh lakes and six meres in Cheshire, England, with well-described fish faunas. Water samples (N = 252) were assayed using two mitochondrial DNA regions (Cytb and 12S rRNA). eDNA sampling indicated the presence of very similar species in the lakes compared to those expected on the basis of existing and historical information. Firstly, 24 species were detected, with a total of 111 species occurrences in the lakes studied using eDNA. Secondly, there was a significant positive correlation between expected faunas and eDNA data in terms of confidence of species occurrence (Spearman's r = 0.74, df = 109, p < 0.001). Thirdly, eDNA data can estimate relative abundance with the standard five-level classification scale (‘DAFOR’). Lastly, four ecological fish communities were characterized using eDNA data which agree with the predefined lake types according to environmental characteristics. Synthesis and applications. There are some limitations when using conventional captured-based methods for surveying species richness and relative abundance, such as morphological identification bias, difficulties in recording small-bodied, rare and/or elusive species and destructive impacts on the environment. This study provides further evidence that environmental DNA metabarcoding outperforms other captured-based survey techniques in a wide range of lake types for community-level analysis whether in species detection, relative abundance estimate using the standard five-level classification scale or characterization ecological fish communities. Therefore, the fish-based environmental DNA metabarcoding, a non-invasive genetic method, has great potential as an assessment tool for lake quality under the European Water Framework Directive.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","abundance estimate | community ecology | EC Water Framework Directive | eDNA | fish monitoring methods | lake assessment | metabarcoding | species detection","29547","undefined","China Scholarship Council","0","FALSE","46","56","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Invertebrate generalist predators are ubiquitous and play a major role in food-web dynamics. Molecular gut content analysis (MGCA) has become a popular means to assess prey ranges and specificity of cryptic arthropods in the absence of direct observation. While this approach has been widely used to study predation on economically important taxa (i.e., pests) in agroecosystems, it is less frequently used to study the broader trophic interactions involving generalist predators in natural communities such as the diverse and threatened coastal sage scrub communities of Southern California. Here, we employ DNA metabarcoding-based MGCA and survey the taxonomically and ecologically diverse prey range of Phymata pacifica Evans, a generalist flower-associated ambush bug (Hemiptera: Reduviidae). We detected predation on a wide array of taxa including beneficial pollinators, potential pests, and other predatory arthropods. The success of this study demonstrates the utility of MGCA in natural ecosystems and can serve as a model for future diet investigations into other cryptic and underrepresented communities.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","biodiversity | blocking primers | DNA detectability half-life | Eriogonum fasciculatum | food webs | intraguild predation | natural enemies","21100307458","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","47","10","5",NA,"e02712",NA,NA,2019

Molecular Ecology Resources Published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Although DNA metabarcoding is an attractive approach for monitoring biodiversity, it is often difficult to detect all the species present in a bulk sample. In particular, sequence recovery for a given species depends on its biomass and mitome copy number as well as the primer set employed for PCR. To examine these variables, we constructed a mock community of terrestrial arthropods comprised of 374 species. We used this community to examine how species recovery was impacted when amplicon pools were constructed in four ways. The first two protocols involved the construction of bulk DNA extracts from different body segments (Bulk Abdomen, Bulk Leg). The other protocols involved the production of DNA extracts from single legs which were then merged prior to PCR (Composite Leg) or PCR-amplified separately (Single Leg) and then pooled. The amplicons generated by these four treatments were then sequenced on three platforms (Illumina MiSeq, Ion Torrent PGM and Ion Torrent S5). The choice of sequencing platform did not substantially influence species recovery, although the Miseq delivered the highest sequence quality. As expected, species recovery was most efficient from the Single Leg treatment because amplicon abundance varied little among taxa. Among the three treatments where PCR occurred after pooling, the Bulk Abdomen treatment produced a more uniform read abundance than the Bulk Leg or Composite Leg treatment. Primer choice also influenced species recovery and evenness. Our results reveal how variation in protocols can have substantial impacts on perceived diversity unless sequencing coverage is sufficient to reach an asymptote.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","community ecology | DNA barcoding | ecological genetics | environmental DNA","11700154306","undefined","Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science","1","TRUE","48","19","3","30779309",NA,NA,NA,2019

Published by Oxford University Press. BACKGROUND: In light of the current biodiversity crisis, DNA barcoding is developing into an essential tool to quantify state shifts in global ecosystems. Current barcoding protocols often rely on short amplicon sequences, which yield accurate identification of biological entities in a community but provide limited phylogenetic resolution across broad taxonomic scales. However, the phylogenetic structure of communities is an essential component of biodiversity. Consequently, a barcoding approach is required that unites robust taxonomic assignment power and high phylogenetic utility. A possible solution is offered by sequencing long ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicons on the MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). FINDINGS: Using a dataset of various animal and plant species, with a focus on arthropods, we assemble a pipeline for long rDNA barcode analysis and introduce a new software (MiniBar) to demultiplex dual indexed Nanopore reads. We find excellent phylogenetic and taxonomic resolution offered by long rDNA sequences across broad taxonomic scales. We highlight the simplicity of our approach by field barcoding with a miniaturized, mobile laboratory in a remote rainforest. We also test the utility of long rDNA amplicons for analysis of community diversity through metabarcoding and find that they recover highly skewed diversity estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Sequencing dual indexed, long rDNA amplicons on the MinION platform is a straightforward, cost-effective, portable, and universal approach for eukaryote DNA barcoding. Although bulk community analyses using long-amplicon approaches may introduce biases, the long rDNA amplicons approach signifies a powerful tool for enabling the accurate recovery of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity across biological communities.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","biodiversity | eukaryotes | long DNA barcodes | metabarcoding | MinION | Oxford Nanopore Technologies | ribosomal","21100420802","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","50","8","5","30824940",NA,NA,NA,2019

In contrast with those of marine environments, freshwater PPE groups have received little attention. In this work, we used flow cytometry cell sorting, microscopy and metabarcoding to investigate the composition of small photosynthetic eukaryote communities from six eutrophic shallow lakes in South America, Argentina. We compared the total molecular diversity obtained from PPE sorted populations as well as from filtered total plankton samples (FTP). Most reads obtained from sorted populations belonged to the classes: Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae. We retrieved sequences from non-photosynthetic groups, such as Chytridiomycetes and Ichthyosporea which contain a number of described parasites, indicating that these organisms were probably in association with the autotrophic cells sorted. Dominant groups among sorted PPEs were poorly represented in FTP and their richness was on average lower than in the sorted samples. A significant number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were exclusively found in sorting samples, emphasizing that sequences from FTP underestimate the diversity of PPE. Moreover, 22% of the OTUs found among the dominant groups had a low similarity (<95%) with reported sequences in public databases, demonstrating a high potential for novel diversity in these lakes.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","eutrophic shallow lakes | flow cytometry | metabarcoding | picoplankton","19705","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","51","95","5","30889236",NA,NA,NA,2019

This is particularly true for the vast part of soil biodiversity, which rarely can be observed directly. Metabarcoding of DNA extracted from the environment (eDNA) has become state-of-the-art in assessing soil biodiversity. For assessing fungal communities, eDNA metabarcoding is seen as an attractive alternative to classical surveying based on fruitbodies. However, it is unknown whether eDNA metabarcoding provides a representative sample of fungal diversity and census of threatened species. Therefore conservation planning and assessment are still based on fruitbody inventories. Based on a dataset of large ecological width, representing both soil eDNA metabarcoding and expert inventories of fungal fruitbodies in Denmark, we document for the first time the validity of eDNA sampling and metabarcoding as a practical inventory method and a measure of conservation value for fungi. Fruitbody data identified fewer species in total and per site, and had larger variance in site richness. Focusing on macrofungi – the class Agaricomycetes, and in turn the order Agaricales – metrics of total richness and compositional similarity converged between the methods. eDNA was suboptimal for recording the non-soil dwelling fungi such as lichens and polypores. ß-Diversity was similar between methods, but more variation in community composition could be explained by environmental predictors in the eDNA data. The fruitbody survey was slightly better at finding red listed species. We find a better correspondence between biodiversity indices derived from fungal fruitbodies and DNA-based approaches than indicated in earlier studies. We argue that (historical) fungal community data based on fruitbody forays – with careful selection of taxonomic groups – may be interpreted together with modern DNA-based approaches to obtain a richer picture of the full mycobiota of the site, and for addressing historical changes. We estimated the costs of the two inventory approaches to be approximately similar for practical applications.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Community composition | Environmental DNA | Environmental gradients | Fungal fruitbodies | Metabarcoding | Red listed species | Species richness","17244","VKR-023343","Villum Fonden","0","FALSE","52","233",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0006320718314435",2019

BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma cruzi is a zoonotic pathogen of increasing relevance in the USA, with a growing number of autochthonous cases identified in recent years. The identification of parasite genotypes is key to understanding transmission cycles and their dynamics and consequently human infection. Natural T. cruzi infection is present in captive nonhuman primate colonies in the southern USA. METHODS: We investigated T. cruzi genetic diversity through a metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing approach of the mini-exon gene to characterize the parasite genotypes circulating in nonhuman primates in southern Louisiana. RESULTS: We confirmed the presence of T. cruzi in multiple tissues of 12 seropositive animals, including heart, liver, spleen and gut. The TcI discrete typing unit (DTU) predominated in these hosts, and specifically TcIa, but we also detected two cases of coinfections with TcVI and TcIV parasites, unambiguously confirming the circulation of TcVI in the USA. Multiple mini-exon haplotypes were identified in each host, ranging from 6 to 11. CONCLUSIONS: The observation of multiple T. cruzi sequence haplotypes in each nonhuman primate indicates possible multiclonal infections. These data suggest the participation of these nonhuman primates in local parasite transmission cycles and highlight the value of these naturally infected animals for the study of human Chagas disease.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Chagas disease | epidemiology | genotyping | transmission | zoonosis","23046","P51 OD011104","National Institutes of Health","0","FALSE","55","113","5","30452731",NA,"NIH",NA,2019

The results were used to define the six most Fg-resistant and the six most Fg-conducive soils. By using a metabarcoding approach, the diversity of the bacterial communities was significantly higher in Fg-resistant soils than in Fg-conducive soils. Microbial taxa potentially contributing to Fg-fungistasis of soil were selected if they were significantly more prevalent and/or abundant in Fg-resistant soils than in Fg-conducive soils. Some of these candidate indicators, e.g. Pseudomonas spp. and Bacillus spp., have been reported previously as effective biocontrol agents against plant pathogens. Correlation-based network analysis further showed that the members of the bacterial communities in Fg-resistant soils were more connected than in Fg-conducive soils. Moreover, network modules was found significantly correlated with certain edaphic abiotics factors (such as the soil manganese and nitrogen content) and Fg-fungistasis.

We examined factors contributing to this unexpected distribution of martens by 1) analyzing marten diets using DNA metabarcoding to assess 90 scats, 2) using camera traps to assess differences in the relative abundances of prey, competitors, and predators across a coastal to inland gradient of vegetation types, and 3) quantifying differences in extent of fruit-producing shrubs and vegetation structure within vegetation types. Diets of martens were diverse (12, 10, and 3 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians respectively), and most fall and winter scats contained fruit. Voles, mice, and varied thrushes (Ixoreus naevius) were dominant prey items. Voles, mice, and most birds, but not varied thrushes, were more commonly observed in the coastal shrub-dominated forest than in inland forest. The coastal shrub-dominated forest had the highest diversity of vertebrates and potential prey overall. Bobcats (Lynx rufus), a key potential predator, were more commonly detected in inland forest. Of potential competitors, western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis) were more commonly detected in inland forest, with gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) detected almost exclusively in coastal forests. Vegetation in coastal forests appears to provide, at least seasonally, more prey and fruit, and more overhead shrub cover compared with inland forest. Remaining plausible hypotheses for the restricted distribution of marten to coastal forests include increased prey, fruit, and overhead cover, and reduced predation risk from bobcats.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"10600153309","undefined","U.S. Department of Agriculture","1","TRUE","57","14","5","31042737","e0214653","USDA",NA,2019

The digestive and respiratory tracts of chickens are colonized by bacteria that are believed to play important roles in the overall health and performance of the birds. Most of the current research on the commensal bacteria (microbiota) of chickens has focused on broilers and gut microbiota, and less attention has been given to layers and respiratory microbiota. This research bias has left significant gaps in our knowledge of the layer microbiome. This study was conducted to define the core microbiota colonizing the upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower intestinal tract (LIT) in commercial layers under field conditions. One hundred eighty-one chickens were sampled from a flock of > 80,000 birds at nine times to collect samples for 16S rRNA gene-based bacterial metabarcoding. Generally, the body site and age/farm stage had very dominant effects on the quantity, taxonomic composition, and dynamics of core bacteria. Remarkably, ileal and URT microbiota were compositionally more related to each other than to that from the cecum. Unique taxa dominated in each body site yet some taxa overlapped between URT and LIT sites, demonstrating a common core. The overlapping bacteria also contained various levels of several genera with well-recognized avian pathogens. Our findings suggest that significant interaction exists between gut and respiratory microbiota, including potential pathogens, in all stages of the farm sequence.

Journal of Animal Ecology © 2019 British Ecological Society Crop raiding by wildlife poses major threats to both wildlife conservation and human well-being in agroecosystems worldwide. These threats are particularly acute in many parts of Africa, where crop raiders include globally threatened megafauna such as elephants, and where smallholder agriculture is a primary source of human livelihood. One framework for understanding herbivore feeding behaviour, the forage-maturation hypothesis, predicts that herbivores should align their movements with intermediate forage biomass (i.e., peak green-up); this phenomenon is known as “surfing the green wave.” Crop-raiding elephants, however, often consume not just foliage, but also fruits and tubers (e.g., maize and potatoes), which generally mature after seasonal peaks in photosynthetic activity. Thus, although elephants have been reported to surf the green wave in natural habitats, they may utilize a different strategy in cultivated landscapes by selecting crops that are “browning down.” We sought to understand the factors that underpin movement of elephants into agricultural landscapes. In Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park, we used movement data from GPS-collared elephants, together with precipitation records, remotely sensed estimates of landscape greenness (NDVI), DNA-based diet analysis, measurements of plant nutritional quality and survey-based metrics of crop availability to understand spatiotemporal variation in elephant crop-raiding behaviour. Elephants tracked peak NDVI while foraging inside the Park. During the dry season, however, when NDVI within the Park declined and availability of mature crops was high, crop raiding increased dramatically, and elephants consistently selected crop plants that were browning down while foraging in cultivated landscapes. Crops contained significantly higher digestible energy than wild food plants, but comparable (and sometimes lower) levels of digestible protein, suggesting that this foraging strategy maximized energy rather than protein intake. Our study is the first to combine GPS tracking data with high-resolution diet analysis and community-based reporting of crop availability to reveal fine-scale plasticity in foraging behaviour of elephants at the human–wildlife interface. Our results extend the forage-maturation hypothesis by showing that elephants surf waves of plant brown-down in cultivated landscapes. These findings can aid efforts to reduce human–elephant conflict by enabling wildlife managers to prioritize mitigation actions in time and space with limited resources.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","behavioural plasticity | crop raiding | DNA metabarcoding | human–wildlife conflict | Loxodonta africana | movement ecology | Normalized Difference Vegetation Index | protected area management","29544","IOS-1656527","National Science Foundation","0","FALSE","59","88","5","30825191",NA,NA,NA,2019

Thus, understanding which aspects of root-associated fungal community ecology generalise across contexts is the first step towards a more predictive framework. We investigated how the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors scale across environmental and ecological contexts using high-throughput sequencing (ca. 55 M Illumina metabarcoding sequences) of >260 plant-root-associated fungal communities from six UK salt marshes across two geographic regions (South-East and North-West England) in winter and summer. Levels of root-associated fungal diversity were comparable with forests and temperate grasslands, quadrupling previous estimates of salt-marsh fungal diversity. Whilst abiotic variables were generally most important, a range of site- and spatial scale-specific abiotic and biotic drivers of diversity and community composition were observed. Consequently, predictive models of diversity trained on one site, extrapolated poorly to others. Fungal taxa from the same functional groups responded similarly to the specific drivers of diversity and composition.

Diversity and Distributions Published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Aim: The tinder fungus Fomes fomentarius is a pivotal wood decomposer in European beech Fagus sylvatica forests. The fungus, however, has regionally declined due to centuries of logging. To unravel biogeographical drivers of arthropod communities associated with this fungus, we investigated how space, climate and habitat amount structure alpha and beta diversity of arthropod communities in fruitbodies of F. fomentarius. Location: Temperate zone of Europe. Taxon: Arthropods. Methods: We reared arthropods from fruitbodies sampled from 61 sites throughout the range of European beech and identified 13 orders taxonomically or by metabarcoding. We estimated the total number of species occurring in fruitbodies of F. fomentarius in European beech forests using the Chao2 estimator and determined the relative importance of space, climate and habitat amount by hierarchical partitioning for alpha diversity and generalized dissimilarity models for beta diversity. A subset of fungi samples was sequenced for identification of the fungus’ genetic structure. Results: The total number of arthropod species occurring in fruitbodies of F. fomentarius across European beech forests was estimated to be 600. Alpha diversity increased with increasing fruitbody biomass; it decreased with increasing longitude, temperature and latitude. Beta diversity was mainly composed by turnover. Patterns of beta diversity were only weakly linked to space and the overall explanatory power was low. We could distinguish two genotypes of F. fomentarius, which showed no spatial structuring. Main conclusion: Fomes fomentarius hosts a large number of arthropods in European beech forests. The low biogeographical and climatic structure of the communities suggests that fruitbodies represent a habitat that offers similar conditions across large gradients of climate and space, but are characterized by high local variability in community composition and colonized by species with high dispersal ability. For European beech forests, retention of trees with F. fomentarius and promoting its recolonization where it had declined seems a promising conservation strategy.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","31","dead wood | Fagus sylvatica | Fomes fomentarius | insects | invertebrates | restoration | saproxylic | sporocarp","14551","20184304",NA,"1","TRUE","61","25","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Journal of Ecology © 2018 British Ecological Society Megafauna assemblages have declined or disappeared throughout much of the world, and many efforts are underway to restore them. Understanding the trophic ecology of such reassembling systems is necessary for predicting recovery dynamics, guiding management, and testing general theory. Yet, there are few studies of recovering large-mammal communities, and fewer still that have characterized food-web structure with high taxonomic resolution. In Gorongosa National Park, large herbivores have rebounded from near-extirpation following the Mozambican Civil War (1977–1992). However, contemporary community structure differs radically from the prewar baseline: medium-sized ungulates now outnumber larger bodied species, and several apex carnivores remain locally extinct. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet composition of Gorongosa’s 14 most abundant large-mammal populations. We tested five hypotheses: (i) the most abundant populations exhibit greatest individual-level dietary variability; (ii) these populations also have the greatest total niche width (dietary diversity); (iii) interspecific niche overlap is high, with the diets of less-abundant species nested within those of more-abundant species; (iv) partitioning of forage species is stronger in more structurally heterogeneous habitats; and (v) selectivity for plant taxa converges within guilds and digestive types, but diverges across them. Abundant (and narrow-mouthed) populations exhibited higher among-individual dietary variation, but not necessarily the greatest dietary diversity. Interspecific dietary overlap was high, especially among grazers and in structurally homogenous habitat, whereas niche separation was more pronounced among browsers and in heterogeneous habitat. Patterns of selectivity were similar for ruminants—grazers and browsers alike—but differed between ruminants and non-ruminants. Synthesis. The structure of this recovering food web was consistent with several hypotheses predicated on competition, habitat complexity, and herbivore traits, but it differed from patterns observed in more intact assemblages. We propose that intraspecific competition in the fastest-recovering populations has promoted individual variation and a more nested food web, wherein rare species use subsets of foods eaten by abundant species, and that this scenario is reinforced by weak predation pressure. Future work should test these conjectures and analyse how the taxonomic dietary niche axis studied here interacts with other mechanisms of diet partitioning to affect community reassembly following wildlife declines.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","community assembly | herbivory | individual specialization | intraspecific niche variation | molecular diet analysis | restoration ecology | species coexistence | trophic rewilding","29602","DEB-1355122","DigitalGlobe Foundation","0","FALSE","62","107","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Stygofauna, or stygobionts -subterranean obligate aquatic animals - provide ecosystem services such as grazing biofilms and maintaining water quality, but we know little about how their ecosystems function. The cryptic nature of groundwaters, together with the high degree of local endemism and stygofaunal site-specific adaptations, represent major obstacles for the field. To overcome these challenges, and integrate biodiversity and ecosystem function, requires a holistic design drawing on classical ecology, taxonomy, molecular ecology and geochemistry. This study presents an approach based on the integration of existing concepts in groundwater ecology with three more novel scientific techniques: compound specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of amino acids, radiocarbon analysis ( 14 C) and DNA analyses of environmental samples, stygofauna and gut contents. The combination of these techniques allows elucidation of aspects of ecosystem function that are often obscured in small invertebrates and cryptic systems. Carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) CSIA provides a linkage between biogeochemical patterns and ecological dynamics. It allows the identification of stygofaunal food web structures and energy flows based on the metabolic pathway of specific amino groups. Concurrently, 14 C provides complementary data on the carbon recycling and incorporation within the stygobiotic trophic webs. Changes in groundwater environmental conditions (e.g. aquifer recharge), and subsequent community adaptations, can be pinpointed via the measurementof the radiocarbon fingerprint of water, sediment and specimens. DNA analyses are a rapidly expanding approach in ecology. eDNA is mainly employed as a biomonitoring tool, while metabarcoding of individuals and/or gut contents provides insight into diet regimes. In all cases, the application of the approaches in combination provides more powerful data than any one alone. By combining quantitative (CSIA and 14 C) and qualitative (eDNA and DNA metabarcoding) approaches via Bayesian Mixing Models (BMM), linkages can be made between community composition, energy and nutrient sources in the system, and trophic function. This suggested multidisciplinary design will contribute to a more thorough comprehension of the biogeochemical and ecological patterns within these undervalued but essential ecosystems.","2","Journal","re","Review","100","10","14  C | Bayesian mixing models | CSIA | DNA metabarcoding | eDNA | Groundwater | Stygofauna | Trophic ecology","25349","LP140100555","Australian Museum","0","FALSE","63","662",NA,"30795483",NA,NA,"S0048969719303390",2019

Variation in environmental conditions can result in disparate associations between hosts and microbial symbionts. As such, it is imperative to evaluate how environmental variables (e.g., habitat quality) can influence host-associated microbiome composition. Within wildlife conservation programs, captive conditions can negatively influence the establishment and maintenance of “wild-type” microbiotas within a host. Alternative microbial communities can result in the proliferation of disease among captive stock or upon reintroduction. Hellbenders (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) are a threatened salamander for which extensive captive management is currently employed. Using metabarcoding, we characterized the skin microbiota of wild and captive hellbenders from two subspecies in the state of Missouri, the eastern (C. a. alleganiensis) and the Ozark hellbender (C. a. bishopi). Both subspecies in our study included wild adults and captive juveniles that were collected from the wild as eggs. Our objectives were to investigate differences in the skin microbial communities’ richness/diversity, composition, and functional profiles of microbes between wild and captive individuals. Captive eastern hellbenders possessed richer communities than wild cohorts, whereas the opposite pattern was observed within the Ozark subspecies. We found significant microbial community structure between wild and captive populations of both subspecies. Microbiota structure translated into differences in the predicted metagenome of wild and captive individuals as well. As such, we can expect captive hellbenders to experience alternative microbial structure and function upon reintroduction into the wild. Our study provides a baseline for the effect of captivity on the skin microbial communities of hellbenders, and highlights the need to incorporate microbiota management in current captive-rearing programs.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","16S rRNA | Amphibian conservation | Amphibian skin microbiota | Eastern hellbender | Metabarcoding | Ozark hellbender","20266","undefined","Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale School of Medicine","0","FALSE","64","77","3","30209587",NA,NA,NA,2019

Yields of genomic DNA with PCR-identifiable 18S rRNA gene sequence from single cells was low (15% of aplastidic cell sorts, and 7% of plastidic sorts) and tests with alternate primers and comparisons to metabarcoding did not reveal phylogenetic bias in the major protist groups. There was little evidence of significant bias against or in favor of any phylogenetic group expected or known to be present. The four open ocean stations in the Indian Ocean had similar communities, despite ranging from 14°N to 20°S latitude, and they differed from the Mediterranean station.

Rapid climate change due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is pushing corals to and past their physiological limits, while their microbiome is being pressed towards dysbiosis. Microbes greatly influence the health and functioning of corals, but thermal anomalies that cause bleaching can affect certain taxa of the host-associated prokaryote and Symbiodiniaceae communities, leading corals towards a disease-prone state. In some coral species, however, even significant thermal stress may not result in visible signs of bleaching. Whether changes in the coral microbiome occur in these resilient species during temperature anomalies is not well described. In the present study, we tagged, visually assessed and sampled 10 colonies of the branching coral Pocillopora acuta on a fringing reef off Orpheus Island in the central Great Barrier Reef for 1 yr, of which the summer coincided with the 2016 mass-bleaching event. No visible signs of bleaching were observed in any of the 10 colonies throughout the study period, despite experiencing two degree heating weeks of thermal stress and observations of bleaching in other coral species on the same reef. Metabarcoding based on the Symbiodiniaceae ITS2 rDNA spacer and the bacterial 16S rRNA gene provided evidence for stability of the overall microbial community structure, although the bacterial community showed increases in a number of potentially beneficial taxa, such as diazotrophs, during the thermal stress event. These findings suggest some flexibility in the microbiome to adjust to higher than average temperatures without disrupting microbiome stability, perhaps contributing to the thermal resilience of P. acuta.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","Coral | Host-microbe interaction | Microbiome composition | Thermal stress","26825","undefined","James Cook University","0","FALSE","66","38","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Background: Although high-throughput marker gene studies provide valuable insight into the diversity and relative abundance of taxa in microbial communities, they do not provide direct measures of their functional capacity. Recently, scientists have shown a general desire to predict functional profiles of microbial communities based on phylogenetic identification inferred from marker genes, and recent tools have been developed to link the two. However, to date, no large-scale examination has quantified the correlation between the marker gene based taxonomic identity and protein coding gene conservation. Here we utilize 4872 representative prokaryotic genomes from NCBI to investigate the relationship between marker gene identity and shared protein coding gene content. Results: Even at 99-100% marker gene identity, genomes share on average less than 75% of their protein coding gene content. This occurs regardless of the marker gene(s) used: V4 region of the 16S rRNA, complete 16S rRNA, or single copy orthologs through a multi-locus sequence analysis. An important aspect related to this observation is the intra-organism variation of 16S copies from a single genome. Although the majority of 16S copies were found to have high sequence similarity (> 99%), several genomes contained copies that were highly diverged (< 97% identity). Conclusions: This is the largest comparison between marker gene similarity and shared protein coding gene content to date. The study highlights the limitations of inferring a microbial community's functions based on marker gene phylogeny. The data presented expands upon the results of previous studies that examined one or few bacterial species and supports the hypothesis that 16S rRNA and other marker genes cannot be directly used to fully predict the functional potential of a bacterial community.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","16S rRNA | Amplicon | Comparative genomics | Functional capacity | Marker gene | Metabarcoding | Metagenomics","21727","5 P20 GM 10350605",NA,"1","TRUE","67","20","1","30947688","268",NA,NA,2019

The aim of this study was to identify the diversity and relative abundance of bacterial genera in Glossina palpalis palpalis flies collected in two trypanosomiasis foci in Cameroon. Methods: Samples of G. p. palpalis which were either negative or naturally trypanosome-positive were collected in two foci located in southern Cameroon (Campo and Bipindi). Using the V3V4 and V4 variable regions of the small subunit of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, we analyzed the respective bacteriome of the flies' midguts. Results: We identified ten bacterial genera.

The remaining genera represented approximately 1% of the bacterial flora, and were composed of Salmonella, Spiroplasma, Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Acidibacter, Tsukamurella, Serratia, Kluyvera and an unidentified bacterium. The genus Sodalis was present but with a very low abundance. Globally, no statistically significant difference was found between the bacterial compositions of flies from the two foci, and between positive and trypanosome-negative flies. However, Salmonella and Serratia were only described in trypanosome-negative flies, suggesting a potential role for these two bacteria in fly refractoriness to trypanosome infection. In addition, our study showed the V4 region of the small subunit of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was more efficient than the V3V4 region at describing the totality of the bacterial diversity. Conclusions: A very large diversity of bacteria was identified with the discovering of species reported to secrete anti-parasitic compounds or to modulate vector competence in other insects. For future studies, the analyses should be enlarged with larger sampling including foci from several countries.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Bacterial flora | Glossina | Metabarcoding | Nagana | Sleeping sickness | Trypanosome","17500154721","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","69","12","1","30940213","151",NA,NA,2019

In diet metabarcoding analyses, insufficient taxonomic coverage of PCR primer sets generates false negatives that may dramatically distort biodiversity estimates. In this paper, we investigated the taxonomic coverage and complementarity of three cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) primer sets based on in silico analyses and we conducted an in vivo evaluation using fecal and spider web samples from different invertivores, environments, and geographic locations. Our results underline the lack of predictability of both the coverage and complementarity of individual primer sets: (a) sharp discrepancies exist observed between in silico and in vivo analyses (to the detriment of in silico analyses); (b) both coverage and complementarity depend greatly on the predator and on the taxonomic level at which preys are considered; (c) primer sets’ complementarity is the greatest at fine taxonomic levels (molecular operational taxonomic units [MOTUs] and variants). We then formalized the “one-locus-several-primer-sets” (OLSP) strategy, that is, the use of several primer sets that target the same locus (here the first part of the COI gene) and the same group of taxa (here invertebrates). The proximal aim of the OLSP strategy is to minimize false negatives by increasing total coverage through multiple primer sets. We illustrate that the OLSP strategy is especially relevant from this perspective since distinct variants within the same MOTUs were not equally detected across all primer sets. Furthermore, the OLSP strategy produces largely overlapping and comparable sequences, which cannot be achieved when targeting different loci. This facilitates the use of haplotypic diversity information contained within metabarcoding datasets, for example, for phylogeography and finer analyses of prey–predator interactions.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","12","cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene | diet analysis | eDNA | false negatives | metabarcoding | PCR primers","26916","ANR-10- LABX-25-01","Labex","1","TRUE","70","9","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Here, we use eDNA metabarcoding to survey marine biodiversity in the vicinity of the three offshore gas platforms in North Adriatic Sea (Italy). We isolated eDNA from 576 water and sediment samples collected at 32 sampling sites situated along four axes at increasing distances from the gas platforms. We obtained about 46 million eDNA sequences for 5 markers from nuclear 18S V1V2, 18S V4, 18S 37F and mitochondrial 16S and COI genes that cover a wide diversity of benthic and planktonic eukaryotes. Our results showed some impact of platform activities on benthic and pelagic communities at very close distance (<50 m), while communities for intermediate (125 m, 250 m, 500 m) and reference (1000 m, 2000 m) sites did not show any particular biodiversity changes that could be related to platforms activities. The most significant community change along the distance gradient was obtained with the 18S V1V2 marker targeting benthic eukaryotes, even though other markers showed similar trends, but to a lesser extent. These results were congruent with the AMBI index inferred from the eDNA sequences assigned to benthic macrofauna. We finally explored the relation between various physicochemical parameters, including hydrocarbons, on benthic community in the case of one of the platforms. Our results showed that these communities were not significantly impacted by most of hydrocarbons, but rather by macro-elements and sediment texture.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Adriatic sea | Biomonitoring | eDNA metabarcoding | Environmental gradient | Gas platforms | Pollution gradient","24021","316030_150817","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung","0","FALSE","71","146",NA,"30890270",NA,NA,"S0141113618306780",2019

Published by Oxford University Press. BACKGROUND: The use of environmental DNA for species detection via metabarcoding is growing rapidly. We present a co-designed lab workflow and bioinformatic pipeline to mitigate the 2 most important risks of environmental DNA use: sample contamination and taxonomic misassignment. These risks arise from the need for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to detect the trace amounts of DNA combined with the necessity of using short target regions due to DNA degradation. FINDINGS: Our high-throughput workflow minimizes these risks via a 4-step strategy: (i) technical replication with 2 PCR replicates and 2 extraction replicates; (ii) using multi-markers (12S,16S,CytB); (iii) a ""twin-tagging,"" 2-step PCR protocol; and (iv) use of the probabilistic taxonomic assignment method PROTAX, which can account for incomplete reference databases. Because annotation errors in the reference sequences can result in taxonomic misassignment, we supply a protocol for curating sequence datasets. For some taxonomic groups and some markers, curation resulted in >50% of sequences being deleted from public reference databases, owing to (i) limited overlap between our target amplicon and reference sequences, (ii) mislabelling of reference sequences, and (iii) redundancy. Finally, we provide a bioinformatic pipeline to process amplicons and conduct PROTAX assignment and tested it on an invertebrate-derived DNA dataset from 1,532 leeches from Sabah, Malaysia. Twin-tagging allowed us to detect and exclude sequences with non-matching tags. The smallest DNA fragment (16S) amplified most frequently for all samples but was less powerful for discriminating at species rank. Using a stringent and lax acceptance criterion we found 162 (stringent) and 190 (lax) vertebrate detections of 95 (stringent) and 109 (lax) leech samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our metabarcoding workflow should help research groups increase the robustness of their results and therefore facilitate wider use of environmental and invertebrate-derived DNA, which is turning into a valuable source of ecological and conservation information on tetrapods.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","environmental DNA | invertebrate-derived -DNA | leeches | metabarcoding","21100420802","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","73","8","4","30997489",NA,NA,NA,2019

Here, we employed the newly developed high-throughput sequencing-based metabarcoding to characterize dinocyst communities collected from the South China Sea. Further, we clarified the spatial–temporal distribution patterns and analyzed the correlation between environmental factors and the observed patterns to investigate how they are influenced by environmental factors. Our results showed that the spatial distribution of dinocyst species richness and abundance varied greatly between sampling sites in different seasons. Both redundancy and Pearson analyses showed that the chemical oxygen femand, which could explained 35.0% of the total community variation, had positive correlations with heterotrophic dinocyst richness and negative correlations with autotrophic dinocysts richness. We did not find significant correlations between heavy metals and any features of dinocyst species richness. No environmental factor showed significant effects on dinocyst abundance based on forward selection after excluding colinearity; however, Pearson’s correlation analyses showed that the abundance of heterotrophic dinocysts presented a significant positive correlation with Mn (P < 0.05). Our results showed that the influence of environmental factors on spatial–temporal distribution of dinocyst species could be region- and/or environment-specific.

The encroachment of shrubs into grasslands is common in terrestrial ecosystems dominated by grass. Land abandonment and favourable climatic trends in recent decades have favoured the expansion of shrubs into subalpine grasslands in many mountainous regions across Europe. The advance of the succession from grassland to shrubland is expected to have a major impact on ecosystem functioning. We used DNA metabarcoding to assess whether the structure of soil fungal communities varied along the succession from subalpine grassland to shrubland in the Pyrenees, and investigated whether shrub encroachment was associated with changes in soil properties. The expansion of shrubs increased the soil C:N ratio and/or reduced the N, P or K contents. Plant-driven changes in soil properties were strongly associated with the compositional turnover of fungi, including arbuscular mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal, ericoid, root endophytic, saprotrophic, lichenised and pathogenic fungi. Total richness and the richness of most functional groups were correlated with soil P, N and the C:N or N:P ratios.

This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. Environmental DNA (eDNA) assays are valuable tools for monitoring the presence and distribution of cryptic species. Like many freshwater mussels, the numbers of dwarf wedgemussel, Alasmidonta heterodon, have dwindled and its range has diminished. As of its listing in 1993, only 10–20 locations were known to persist out of the 70 Atlantic slope locations known historically. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to detect the presence of A. heterodon was developed that uses two probes to accommodate a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the probe-binding site within the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. This SNP defines northern and southern major phylogenetic lineages. The primers match exactly the previously determined COI sequences of 20 dwarf wedgemussel individuals representing Atlantic slope populations from North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New York, and New Hampshire. Other than for the qPCR assay described here, these primers can be used for sequencing or metabarcoding to further delineate dwarf wedgemussel populations phylogenetically. A simple eDNA preparation method is introduced using flocculation to concentrate free DNA in solution as well as cellular material (including shed animal cells, bacteria, viruses, and dissolved DNA). In addition to the specific application described here, the methodological approaches used in this study are widely applicable to conservation, including, but not limited to, general aquatic biodiversity, phylogenetic studies, and the detection of pathogenic microbes.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","endangered species | invertebrates | new techniques | river | stream","17182","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","78","29","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

While conservation management has made tremendous strides to date, deciding where, when and how to invest limited monitoring budgets is a central concern for impactful decision-making. New analytical tools, such as environmental DNA (eDNA), are now facilitating broader biodiversity monitoring at unprecedented scales, in part, due to time, and presumably cost, of methodological efficiency. Genetic approaches vary from conventional PCR (cPCR; species presence), to metabarcoding (community structure), and qPCR (relative DNA abundance, detection sensitivity). Knowing when to employ these techniques over traditional protocols could enable practitioners to make more informed choices concerning data collection. Using 12 species-specific primers designed for cPCR, eDNA analysis of the Yangtze finless porpoise (YFP; Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis), a critically endangered aquatic mammal within the Yangtze River, we validated and optimized these primers for use in qPCR. We tested repeatability and sensitivity to detect YFP eDNA and subsequently compared the cost of traditional (visual and capture) sampling to eDNA tools. Our results suggest cPCR as the least expensive sampling option but the lack of PCR sensitivity suggests it may not be the most robust method for this taxon, predominately useful as a supplementary tool or with large expected populations. Alternatively, qPCR remained less expensive than traditional surveys, representing a highly repeatable and sensitive method for this behaviorally elusive species. Cost comparisons of surveying practices have scarcely been discussed; however, given budgetary constraints particularly for developing countries with limited local oversight but high endemism, we encourage managers to carefully consider the trade-offs among accuracy, cost, coverage, and speed for biodiversity monitoring.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","Environmental DNA | Systematic conservation planning | Yangtze finless porpoise","21662","31400468","National Natural Science Foundation of China","1","TRUE","79","106","3-4","30778682","9",NA,NA,2019

Using a metabarcoding dataset of marine plankton from the global ocean, 318,054 mixotrophic metabarcodes represented by 89,951,866 sequences and belonging to 133 taxonomic lineages were identified and classified into four mixotrophic functional types: constitutive mixotrophs (CM), generalist non-constitutive mixotrophs (GNCM), endo-symbiotic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (eSNCM), and plastidic specialist non-constitutive mixotrophs (pSNCM). Mixotrophy appeared ubiquitous, and the distributions of the four mixotypes were analyzed to identify the abiotic factors shaping their biogeographies. Kleptoplastidic mixotrophs (GNCM and pSNCM) were detected in new zones compared to previous morphological studies. Constitutive and non-constitutive mixotrophs had similar ranges of distributions. Most lineages were evenly found in the samples, yet some of them displayed strongly contrasted distributions, both across and within mixotypes. Particularly divergent biogeographies were found within endo-symbiotic mixotrophs, depending on the ability to form colonies or the mode of symbiosis.

Mammal Review published by Mammal Society and John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Accurate analyses of the diets of predators are key to understand trophic interactions and defining conservation strategies. Diets are commonly assessed through analysis of non-invasively collected scats, and the use of faecal DNA (fDNA) analysis can reduce the species misidentifications that could lead to biased ecological inference. We review the scientific literature since publication of the first paper on amplifying fDNA, in order to assess trends in the use of genetic non-invasive sampling (gNIS) for predator species identification in scat-based diet studies of North American and European terrestrial mammalian carnivores (Carnivora). We quantify error rates in morphology-based predator species identification. We then provide an overview of how applying gNIS would improve research on trophic interactions and other areas of carnivore ecology. We found that carnivore species identity was verified by using gNIS in only 8% of 400 studies of carnivore diets based on scats. The median percentage of false positives (i.e. samples wrongly identified as belonging to the target species) in morphology-based studies was 18%, and was consistent regardless of species’ body size. We did not find an increasing trend in the use of gNIS over time, despite the existing technical capability to identify almost all carnivore species. New directions for fDNA studies include employing high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and DNA metabarcoding to identify the predator species, the individual predator, the entire assemblage of consumed items, and the microbiome of the predator and pathogens. We conclude that HTS protocols and metagenomic approaches hold great promise for elevating gNIS as a fundamental cornerstone for future research in ecology and conservation biology of mammals.","0","Journal","re","Review","100","9","diet assessment | genetic non-invasive sampling | identification accuracy | scat misidentification | species identification","22652","IF/564/2012","Programa Operacional Temático Factores de Competitividade","1","TRUE","83","49","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

The bacterial microbiome is an important component of any aquaculture environment. The interaction between the bacterial microbiome and other microorganisms (e.g. parasites, viruses, or other bacteria) in aquaculture systems can prevent or contribute to disease outbreaks.

An environmental DNA (eDNA) approach was used to estimate the abundance of C. hexasticha (copies/µl) in water through SSU-rDNA gene qPCR and the relative abundance of bacterial species in water and fish gills through 16S rRNA V3 and V4 metabarcoding. The overall bacterial community diversity, dominated by Actinobacteria (42%), Proteobacteria (28%), Bacteroidetes (10%) and Cyanobacteria (6%), was stable among ponds over the study period (p >.05). Of those that could be identified to species, Flavobacterium columnare, Veillonella dispar and Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus abundance correlated with both high C. hexasticha levels in pond water and high observed fish mortalities (p <.05).

One of the main goals of the quality control evaluation is to identify contaminants in raw material, or contamination after a food is processed and before it is placed on the market. During the treatment processes, contamination, both accidental and economically motivated, can generate incongruence between declared and real composition. In our study, we evaluated if DNA metabarcoding is a suitable tool for unveiling the composition of processed food, when it contains small trace amounts. We tested this method on different types of commercial plant products by using tnrL marker and we applied amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing techniques to identify plant components in different food products. Our results showed that DNA metabarcoding can be an effective approach for food traceability in different type of processed food. Indeed, the vast majority of our samples, we identified the species composition as the labels reported. Although some critical issues still exist, mostly deriving from the starting composition (i.e., variable complexity in taxa composition) of the sample itself and the different processing level (i.e., high or low DNA degradation), our data confirmed the potential of the DNA metabarcoding approach also in quantitative analyses for food composition quality control.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","DNA metabarcoding | Food contaminants | Food matrices | Food tracking | Herbal products | High Throughput Sequencing | Molecular markers | Processed food | TrnL","19700188368","undefined","Regione Lombardia","1","TRUE","86","10","3",NA,"248",NA,NA,2019

In this study, sediment samples were collected from seven stations at six salmon farms in British Columbia, Canada, and analyzed for geochemical parameters and by eDNA metabarcoding to investigate linkages between geochemistry and foraminifera.

Farm-specific responses were observed in diversity analyses, taxonomic difference analyses, and correlation analyses. Results demonstrated that species diversity and composition of foraminifera characterized by eDNA metabarcoding generated signals consistent with benthic biodiversity being impacted by finfish farming activities. This substantiates the validity of eDNA metabarcoding for augmenting current approaches to benthic impact assessments by providing more cost-effective and practicable biotic measures than traditional morpho-taxonomy.

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Metabarcoding of arthropod communities can be used for assessing species diversity in tropical forests but the methodology requires validation for accurate and repeatable species occurrences in complex mixtures. This study investigates how the composition of ecological samples affects the accuracy of species recovery. Starting with field-collected bulk samples from the tropical canopy, the recovery of specimens was tested for subsets of different body sizes and major taxa, by assembling these subsets into increasingly complex composite pools. After metabarcoding, we track whether richness, diversity, and most importantly composition of any size class or taxonomic subset are affected by the presence of other subsets in the mixture. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) greatly exceeded the number of morphospecies in most taxa, even under very stringent sequencing read filtering. There was no significant effect on the recovered OTU richness of small and medium-sized arthropods when metabarcoded alongside larger arthropods, despite substantial biomass differences in the mixture. The recovery of taxonomic subsets was not generally influenced by the presence of other taxa, although with some exceptions likely due to primer mismatches. Considerable compositional variation within size and taxon-based subcommunities was evident resulting in high beta-diversity among samples from within a single tree canopy, but this beta-diversity was not affected by experimental manipulation. We conclude that OTU recovery in complex arthropod communities, with sufficient sequencing depth and within reasonable size ranges, is not skewed by variable biomass of the constituent species. This could remove the need for time-intensive manual sorting prior to metabarcoding. However, there remains a chance of taxonomic bias, which may be primer-dependent. There will never be a panacea primer; instead, metabarcoding studies should carefully consider whether the aim is broadscale turnover, in which case these biases may not be important, or species lists, in which case separate PCRs and sequencing might be necessary. OTU number inflation remains an issue in metabarcoding and requires bioinformatic development, particularly in read filtering and OTU clustering, and/or greater use of species-identifying sequences generated outside of bulk sequencing.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","arthropods | body size | compositionality | metabarcoding | sequencing bias | species diversity | taxon composition","26916","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","88","9","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

In this study, we determined the ability of eDNA metabarcoding surveys to distinguish localized signals obtained from four marine habitats within a small spatial scale (<5 km) subject to significant tidal and along-shore water flow. Our eDNA metabarcoding survey detected 86 genera, within 77 families and across 11 phyla using three established metabarcoding assays targeting fish (16S rRNA gene), crustacean (16S rRNA gene) and eukaryotic (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1) diversity. Ordination and cluster analyses for both taxonomic and OTU data sets show distinct eDNA signals between the sampled habitats, suggesting dispersal of eDNA among habitats was limited. Individual taxa with strong habitat preferences displayed localized eDNA signals in accordance with their respective habitat, whereas taxa known to be less habitat-specific generated more ubiquitous signals.

Diet studies provide base understanding of trophic structure and are a valuable initial step for many fields of marine ecology, including conservation and fisheries biology. Considerable complexity in marine trophic structure can exist due to the presence of highly mobile species with long life spans. Mobula rays are highly mobile, large, planktivorous elasmobranchs that are frequently caught either directly or as bycatch in fisheries, which, combined with their conservative life history strategy, makes their populations susceptible to decline in intensely fished regions. Effective management of these iconic and vulnerable species requires an understanding of the diets that sustain them, which can be difficult to determine using conventional sampling methods. We use three DNA metabarcode assays to identify 44 distinct taxa from the stomachs (n = 101) of four sympatric Mobula ray species (Mobula birostris, Mobula tarapacana, Mobula japanica, and Mobula thurstoni) caught over 3 years (2013–2015) in a direct fishery off Bohol in the Philippines. The diversity and incidence of bony fishes observed in ray diets were unprecedented. Nevertheless, rays showed dietary overlap, with krill (Euphausia) dominating their diet. Our results provide a more detailed assessment of sympatric ray diets than was previously described and reveal the complexity that can exist in food webs at critical foraging habitats.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","manta rays | metabarcoding | Myliobatidae | prey","26916","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","90",NA,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The application of high-throughput sequencing to retrieve multi-taxon DNA from different substrates such as water, soil, and stomach contents has enabled species identification without prior knowledge of taxon compositions. Here we used three minibarcodes designed to target mitochondrial COI in plankton, 16S in fish, and 16S in crustaceans, to compare ethanol- and tissue-derived DNA extraction methodologies for metabarcoding. The stomach contents of pygmy devilrays (Mobula kuhlii cf. eregoodootenkee) were used to test whether ethanol-derived DNA would provide a suitable substrate for metabarcoding. The DNA barcoding assays indicated that tissue-derived operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were greater compared to those from extractions performed directly on the ethanol preservative. Tissue-derived DNA extraction is therefore recommended for broader taxonomic coverage. Metabarcoding applications should consider including the following: (i) multiple barcodes, both taxon specific (e.g., 12S or 16S) and more universal (e.g., COI or 18S) to overcome bias and taxon misidentification and (ii) PCR inhibitor removal steps that will likely enhance amplification yields. However, where tissue is limited or no longer available, but the ethanol-preservative medium is still available, metabarcoding directly from ethanol does recover the majority of common OTUs, suggesting the ethanol-retrieval method could be applicable for dietary studies. Metabarcoding directly from preservative ethanol may also be useful where tissue samples are limited or highly valued; bulk samples are collected, such as for rapid species inventories; or mixed-voucher sampling is conducted (e.g., for plankton, insects, and crustaceans).","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","DNA extraction | DNA metabarcoding | Illumina sequencing | marine predator | stomach-content","26916","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","91","9","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

The estimation of the time elapsed since death (post-mortem interval, or PMI) is one of the key themes that forensic scientists have to address frequently. However, the estimation of PMI still suffers from poor accuracy and biases especially when decomposition stages are prolonged, so further improvements in methods for PMI estimation are desirable. Soil microbial communities associated with decomposing bodies have been shown to be good candidates for the estimation of the PMI of exposed bodies. Nevertheless, further research is required to better understand the bacterial succession associated with decomposition of buried carcasses in order to test its reliability and applicability for the estimation of PMI and to better understand the dynamics involved with decomposition within this particular scenario. Therefore we explored the succession of soil microbial communities associated with four decomposing pig carcasses (from one to six months PMI) using a metabarcoding approach. The sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA variable region 4 (V4) revealed trends linking particular microbial taxa with specific PMIs, and notably an increase in Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes at specific PMIs as well as a decrease in Acidobacteria. Our results, in accordance with previous studies conducted on exposed bodies of different mammalian species (including humans), also showed a general reduction of the taxonomic richness from two months PMI onwards, as well as an incomplete re-establishment of the starting soil microbial conditions after six months PMI. We also found specific mammal-derived taxa, such as Bacteroides spp., being still present in the soil after six months PMI. As such, this study serves as a baseline for additional research to allow the characterisation of biomarkers associated with specific PMIs. Due to the similarity between the results presented here and those reported in other types of decomposition studies we believe that the metabarcoding approach has considerable potential in the estimation of the PMI, particularly to clarify cases involving heavily skeletonised bodies or for the investigation of clandestine graves in which the carcass has been moved from its original place of deposition.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","16S rRNA | Decomposition | Metabarcoding | Post-mortem interval | Taphonomy","5700191205","RG130453","Royal Society","0","FALSE","93","39",NA,"30594064",NA,NA,"S187249731830303X",2019

In the 1970s, the introduced silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (which is indigenous to eastern Asia) escaped from southern U.S. aquaculture to spread throughout the Mississippi River basin, and since has steadily moved northward. This large, prolific filter-feeder reduces food availability for other fishes. It now has reached the threshold of the Laurentian Great Lakes, where it likely will significantly impact food chains and fisheries. Our study evaluates population genetic variability and differentiation of the silver carp using 10 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci, and sequences of two mitochondrial genes–cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, along with the nuclear ribosomal protein S7 gene intron 1. We analyze population samples from: two primary Great Lakes’ invasion fronts (at the Illinois River outside of Chicago, IL in Lake Michigan and in the Wabash River, which leads into the Maumee River and western Lake Erie), the original establishment “core” in the Lower Mississippi River, and expansion areas in the Upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers. We analyze and compare our results with bighead and other invasive carps, and cyprinid relatives. Results reveal that the silver carp invasion possesses moderate levels of genetic diversity, with more mtDNA haplotypes and unique microsatellite alleles in the “core” Lower Mississippi River population, which also diverges the most. The two invasion fronts also significantly genetically differ. About 3% of individuals (including all populations except the Illinois River) contain a unique and very divergent mtDNA haplotype, which likely stems from historic introgression in Asia with female largescale silver carp H. harmandi. The nuclear microsatellites and S7 sequences of the introgressed individuals do not differ from silver carp and are very distant from bighead carp. These sequence variation data are employed to design and evaluate a targeted high-throughput metabarcoding sequence assay that identifies and distinguishes among species of invasive carps (i.e., silver, bighead, grass, black, and common carps, along with goldfish), as well as native cyprinids, using cytochrome b. Our assay further differentiates among selected silver carp haplotypes (including between H. molitrix and H. harmandi), for use in population genetics and future analyses of spread pathways. We test and evaluate this assay on environmental (e)DNA water samples from 48 bait shops in the Great Lakes’ region (along the Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and Wabash River watersheds), using positive and negative controls and custom bioinformatic processing. Test results discern silver carp eDNA in four of the shops–three in Lake Erie and one in the Wabash River watershed–and bighead carp from one of the same Lake Erie venues, suggesting that retailers (who often source from established southerly populations) comprise another introduction vector. Our overall findings thus provide key population genetic and phylogenetic data for understanding and tracing introductions, vectors, and spread pathways for silver carp, their variants, and their relatives.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"10600153309","#GL-00E01898.","Cancer Genomics Centre","1","TRUE","95","14","3","30917127","e0203012","CGC",NA,2019

Identifying species and population genetic compositions of biological invasions at early life stages and/or from environmental (e)DNA using targeted high-throughput sequencing (HTS) metabarcode assays offers powerful and cost-effective means for early detection, analysis of spread patterns, and evaluating population changes. The present study develops, tests, and applies this method with a targeted sequence assay designed to simultaneously identify and distinguish between the closely related invasive Eurasian zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis) and their relatives and discern their respective population genetic patterns. Invasions of these dreissenid mussel species have markedly changed freshwater ecosystems throughout North America and Europe, exerting severe ecological and economic damage. Their planktonic early life stages (eggs and larvae) are morphologically indistinguishable, yet each species exerts differential ecological effects, with the quagga often outcompeting the zebra mussel as adults. Our targeted assay analyzes genetic variation from a diagnostic sequence region of the mitochondrial (mt)DNA cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene, to assess temporal and spatial inter- and intra-specific genetic variability. The assay facilitates analysis of environmental (e)DNA from water, early life stages from thousands of individuals, and simultaneous analysis of 50–100 tagged field-collected samples. Experiments evaluated its accuracy and performance using: (a) mock laboratory communities containing known DNA quantities per taxon, (b) aquaria with mixed-species/haplotype compositions of adults, and (c) field-collected water and plankton versus traditional sampling of adult communities. Results delineated species compositions, relative abundances, and population-level diversity differences among ecosystems, habitats, time series, and life stages from two allopatric concurrent invasions in the Great Lakes (Lake Erie) and the Hudson River, which had separate founding histories. Findings demonstrate application of this targeted assay and our approach to accurately and simultaneously discern species- and population-level differences across spatial and temporal scales, facilitating early detection and ecological understanding of biological invasions.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","Dreissena | environmental DNA | Great Lakes | high-throughput sequencing | invasive species","26916","GL-00E01289","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency","1","TRUE","96","9","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

In recent years, environmental DNA (eDNA), coupled with metabarcoding methodologies, has emerged as a promising tool for generating biotic surveys of marine ecosystems, including those under anthropogenic pressure. However, more empirical data are needed on how to best implement eDNA field sampling approaches to maximize their utility for each specific application. The effect of the substrate chosen for eDNA sampling on the diversity of marine taxa detected by DNA metabarcoding has not yet been systematically analysed, despite aquatic systems being those most commonly targeted for eDNA studies. We investigated the effect of four commonly used eDNA substrates to explore taxonomic diversity: (a) surface water, (b) marine sediment, (c) settlement plates and (d) planktonic tows. With a focus on coastal ports, 332 eDNA samples from Australia (Indian and Southern oceans) and Kazakhstan (Caspian Sea) were collected and analysed by multi-assay DNA metabarcoding. Across study locations, between 30% and 52% of eukaryotic families detected were unique to a particular substrate and <6% of families were found in all four substrates. Taxonomic composition varied significantly depending on the substrate sampled implying that the suitability (and bias) of an eDNA substrate will depend on the focal taxa. These findings demonstrate that single substrate eDNA metabarcoding likely underestimates the total eukaryotic diversity. Future eDNA experimental design should consider incorporating multiple substrates or select substrate(s) best suited to the specific detection of target taxa.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","amplicon sequencing | biodiversity | biomonitoring | environmental sampling","11700154306","LP160100839","Australian Research Council","0","FALSE","97","19","2","30485662",NA,NA,NA,2019

Due to the limited number of specialists and challenges with generating objective species inventories, investigating alternative or complementary strategies for compiling lichen inventories is paramount to improve biomonitoring strategies. The aim of this study was to determine if targeted community DNA metabarcoding provides an efficient, objective and reliable approach for characterizing lichen-forming fungal diversity in biomonitoring research. To evaluate if reliable biodiversity data could be obtained efficiently and objectively, metacommunity samples were collected by trained field technicians and a professional lichenologist at a previously established biomonitoring reference site in east-central Nevada, USA. Using amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing of a portion of the fungal DNA barcoding marker, the internal transcribed spacer region, molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were inferred and used as a proxy for species diversity. OTUs from individual sampling efforts and two DNA extraction methods were compared to data from the original, voucher-based inventory at the same site. Treating OTUs as a proxy for species diversity, a 1.6-fold increase in diversity of lichen-forming fungi was observed when comparing the targeted community DNA metabarcoding to the initial, voucher-based inventories – 72 OTUs vs. 43 species. Strikingly, substantial overlap in captured OTU diversity was observed between minimally trained technicians and a professional lichenologist metacommunity samples. Based on these results, targeted community DNA metabarcoding is a promising strategy for creating objective lichen inventories. However, metabarcoding cannot discriminate the presence of established thalli from that of spores or propagules (in absence of established thalli) present in the sample/area. Therefore, targeted community DNA metabarcoding for assessing lichen biodiversity offers a complementary, rather than a substitutive sampling strategy.","0","Journal","ar","Article",NA,NA,"Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program (FIA) | Great Basin | High-throughput sequencing (NGS) | Illumina | Internal transcribed spacer region","20292","undefined","U.S. Forest Service","0","FALSE","98","98",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S1470160X18309233",2019

The DNA polymorphism diffusely present in the introns of the members of the Eukaryotic beta-tubulin gene families, can be conveniently used to establish a DNA barcoding method, named tubulin-based polymorphism (TBP), that can reliably assign specific genomic fingerprintings to any plant or/and animal species. Similarly, many plant varieties can also be barcoded by TBP. The method is based on a simple cell biology concept that finds a conveniently exploitable molecular basis. It does not depend on DNA sequencing as the most classically established DNA barcode strategies. Successful applications, diversified for the different target sequences or experimental purposes, have been reported in many different plant species and, of late, a new a version applicable to animal species, including fishes, has been developed. Also, the TBP method is currently used for the genetic authentication of plant material and derived food products. Due to the use of a couple of universal primer pairs, specific for plant and animal organisms, respectively, it is effective in metabarcoding a complex matrix allowing an easy and rapid recognition of the different species present in a mixture. A simple, dedicated database made up by the genomic profile of reference materials is also part of the analytical procedure. Here we will provide some example of the TBP application and will discuss its features and uses in comparison with the DNA sequencing-based methods.","0","Journal","re","Review","100","5","Food authentication | Genotyping | Metabarcoding | TBP","19700188368","315464","European Commission","1","TRUE","99","10","3",NA,"229",NA,NA,2019

On one hand, entomologists rely mostly on both traditional molecular methods and morphological characteristics, to identify pests. On the other hand, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is becoming the go-to avenue for scientists studying phytopathogens. These organisms sometimes infect plants, together with insects. Considering the growing number of exotic insect introductions in Canada, forest pest-management efforts would benefit from the development of a high-throughput strategy to investigate the phytopathogenic fungal and oomycete species interacting with wood-boring insects. We recycled formerly discarded preservative fluids from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency annual survey using insect traps and analysed more than one hundred samples originating from across Canada. Using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM) HTS technology and fusion primers, we performed metabarcoding to screen unwanted fungi and oomycetes species, including Phytophthora spp. Community profiling was conducted on the four different wood-boring, insect-attracting semiochemicals; although the preservative (contained ethanol) also attracted other insects. Phytopathogenic fungi (e.g., Leptographium spp. and Meria laricis in the pine sawyer semiochemical) and oomycetes (mainly Peronospora spp. and Pythium aff. hypogynum in the General Longhorn semiochemical), solely associated with one of the four types of semiochemicals, were detected. This project demonstrated that the insect traps’ semiochemical microbiome represents a new and powerful matrix for screening phytopathogens. Compared to traditional diagnostic techniques, the fluids allowed for a faster and higher throughput assessment of the biodiversity contained within. Additionally, minimal modifications to this approach would allow it to be used in other phytopathology fields.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Forest | Fungi | Hts | Insects | Metagenomics | Oomycete | Vectors","21100886355","OLF-P-1304","Genome Canada","1","TRUE","102","5","1",NA,"15",NA,NA,2019

How diverse are marine planktonic protist communities? How much seasonality do they exhibit? For a very long time, these two old and challenging questions in the field of plankton ecology could be addressed only for large-size protist species, based on cell counting under the microscope. The recent application of molecular techniques, notably massive marker-gene amplicon sequencing approaches (metabarcoding), has allowed investigating with unprecedented level of resolution the small-sized (<20 µm) planktonic eukaryotes too. An amazing diversity of these tiny organisms has been unveiled but details about their temporal dynamics remain much more elusive. In a From the Cover article in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Giner et al. (2019) introduce a new Recurrence Index (RI) to specifically look for seasonality in time-series metabarcoding data. They inspected the temporal dynamics of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in a rich sequence data set of pico-and nanoplanktonic eukaryotes in samples collected monthly during 10 years. Although most OTUs did not show seasonality, some abundant ones did, which explains why some averaging methods can find seasonality at the less detailed level of whole planktonic communities. Not surprisingly, the very complex small-sized eukaryotic plankton communities are composed of organisms with miscellaneous temporal dynamics.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","2",NA,"20297","322669",NA,"1","TRUE","103","28","5","30938044",NA,NA,NA,2019

Their role in health is not known, although it is suggested that they generate beneficial bioactive compounds upon metabolization by the gut microbiota. During apple processing, procyanidins interact with cell-wall polysaccharides and form stable complexes. These interactions need to be taken into consideration in order to better assess the biological effects of fruit constituents. Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of these interactions on the microbial metabolization of cell walls and procyanidins, and to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory activity of the resulting metabolome, in addition to analyzing the taxonomical changes which the microbiota undergo. In vitro fermentation of three model apple matrices with microbiota from 4 healthy donors showed that the binding of procyanidins to cell-wall polysaccharides, whether covalently or non-covalently, substantially reduced procyanidin degradation. Although cell wall-unbound procyanidins negatively affected carbohydrate fermentation, they generated more hydroxyphenylvaleric acid than bound procyanidins, and increased the abundance of Adlercreutzia and Gordonibacter genera. The best results in terms of production of anti-inflammatory bioactive metabolites were observed from the apple matrix with no bonds between procyanidins and cell wall polysaccharides, although the matrix with non-covalent bonds was not far behind.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","16S metabarcoding | Dietary fiber | In vitro batch fermentation | Metabotype | Polyphenols","19700188323","undefined","Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique","1","TRUE","104","11","3","30893845","664",NA,NA,2019

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Interspecific differences in traits can alter the relative niche use of species within the same environment. Bats provide an excellent model to study niche use because they use a wide variety of behavioral, acoustic, and morphological traits that may lead to multi-species, functional groups. Predatory bats have been classified by their foraging location (edge, clutter, open space), ability to use aerial hawking or substrate gleaning and echolocation call design and flexibility, all of which may dictate their prey use. For example, high frequency, broadband calls do not travel far but offer high object resolution while high intensity, low frequency calls travel further but provide lower resolution. Because these behaviors can be flexible, four behavioral categories have been proposed: (a) gleaning, (b) behaviorally flexible (gleaning and hawking), (c) clutter-tolerant hawking, and (d) open space hawking. Many recent studies of diet in bats use molecular tools to identify prey but mainly focus on one or two species in isolation; few studies provide evidence for substantial differences in prey use despite the many behavioral, acoustic, and morphological differences. Here, we analyze the diet of 17 sympatric species in the Chihuahuan desert and test the hypothesis that peak echolocation frequency and behavioral categories are linked to differences in diet. We find no significant correlation between dietary richness and echolocation peak frequency though it spanned close to 100 kHz across species. Our data, however, suggest that bats which use both gleaning and hawking strategies have the broadest diets and are most differentiated from clutter-tolerant aerial hawking species.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","bat foraging ecology | community ecology | dietary analysis | metabarcoding","26916","RG130793","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","1","TRUE","105","9","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Most research on extant planktonic foraminifera has been directed towards larger species (>0.150 mm) which can be easily manipulated, counted and yield enough calcite for geochemical analyses. This has drawn attention towards the macroperforate clade and created an impression of their numerical and ecological dominance. Drawing such conclusions from the study of such “giants” is a dangerous path. There were times in the evolutionary history of planktonic foraminifera when all species were smaller than 0.1 mm and indeed numerous small taxa, mainly from the microperforate clade, have been formally described from the modern plankton. The significance of these small, obscure and neglected species is poorly characterized and their relationship to the newly discovered hyperabundant but uncharacterized lineages of planktonic foraminifera in metabarcoding datasets is unknown. To determine, who is hiding in the metabarcoding datasets, we carried out an extensive sequencing of 18S rDNA targeted at small and obscure species. The sequences of the newly characterized small and obscure taxa match many of the previously uncharacterized lineages found in metabarcoding data. This indicates that most of the modern diversity in planktonic foraminifera has been taxonomically captured, but the role of the small and neglected taxa has been severely underestimated.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","106","14","3","30897140","e0213936",NA,NA,2019

Mussels of the genus Bathymodiolus are among the most widespread colonizers of hydrothermal vent and cold seep environments, sustained by endosymbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria. Presumed species of Bathymodiolus are abundant at newly discovered cold seeps on the Mid-Atlantic continental slope, however morphological taxonomy is challenging, and their phylogenetic affinities remain unestablished. Here we used mitochondrial sequence to classify species found at three seep sites (Baltimore Canyon seep (BCS; ~400m); Norfolk Canyon seep (NCS; ~1520m); and Chincoteague Island seep (CTS; ~1000m)). Mitochondrial COI (N = 162) and ND4 (N = 39) data suggest that Bathymodiolus childressi predominates at these sites, although single B. mauritanicus and B. heckerae individuals were detected. As previous work had suggested that methanotrophic and thiotrophic interactions can both occur at a site, and within an individual mussel, we investigated the symbiont communities in gill tissues of a subset of mussels from BCS and NCS. We constructed metabarcode libraries with four different primer sets spanning the 16S gene. A methanotrophic phylotype dominated all gill microbial samples from BCS, but sulfur-oxidizing Campylobacterota were represented by a notable minority of sequences from NCS. The methanotroph phylotype shared a clade with globally distributed Bathymodiolus spp. symbionts from methane seeps and hydrothermal vents. Two distinct Campylobacterota phylotypes were prevalent in NCS samples, one of which shares a clade with Campylobacterota associated with B. childressi from the Gulf of Mexico and the other with Campylobacterota associated with other deep-sea fauna. Variation in chemosynthetic symbiont communities among sites and individuals has important ecological and geochemical implications and suggests shifting reliance on methanotrophy. Continued characterization of symbionts from cold seeps will provide a greater understanding of the ecology of these unique environments as well and their geochemical footprint in elemental cycling and energy flux.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","108","14","3","30870419","e0211616",NA,NA,2019

Schizoxylon albescens shows two nutritional modes: it can either live as a borderline lichen on Populus tremula bark or as a saprotroph on Populus wood. This enables us to investigate the microbiota diversity in simple fungal-algal associations and to study the impact of lichenization on the structure of bacterial communities. We sampled three areas in Sweden covering the distribution of Schizoxylon, and using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and fluorescence in situ hybridization we characterized the associated microbiota. Bacterial communities in lichenized and saprotrophic Schizoxylon were clearly distinct, but when comparing the microbiota with the respective substrates, only the fruiting bodies show clear differences in composition and abundance from the communities in the substrates. The colonization by either lichenized or saprotrophic mycelia of Schizoxylon did not significantly influence the microbiota in the substrate. This suggests that in a morphologically simple form of lichenization, as represented by the Schizoxylon-Coccomyxa system, algal-fungal interactions do not significantly influence bacterial communities, but a more complex structure of the lichen thallus is likely required for hosting specific microbiota.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Coccomyxa | FISH | Fungal life style | Metabarcoding | Microbiota | Schizoxylon","19705","VR621–2012-3990","Vetenskapsrådet","0","FALSE","109","95","3","30668688","fiy012",NA,NA,2019

Plants exude various metabolites that may influence the rhizosphere microbiota. However, few studies have sought to understand the role of root exudation in shaping the functional capacities of the microbiota. In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of plants on the diversity of active microbiota and their ability to denitrify via root exudates. For that purpose, we grew four plant species, Triticum aestivum, Brassica napus, Medicago truncatula and Arabidopsis thaliana separately in the same soil. We extracted RNA from the root-adhering soil and the root tissues, and we analysed the bacterial diversity by using 16S rRNA metabarcoding. We measured denitrification activity and denitrification gene expression (nirK and nirS) from each root-adhering soil sample and the root tissues using gas chromatography and quantitative PCR, respectively. We demonstrated that plant species shape denitrification activity and modulate the diversity of the active microbiota through root exudation. We observed a positive effect of T. aestivum and A. thaliana on denitrification activity and nirK gene expression on the root systems.

Compared to bacteria and archaea, fungal community in hadal trenches is poorly documented. In this study, we present, for the first time, results of a comparative survey of the sediment-associated fungal communities at the Yap Trench by using high-throughput sequencing and culture-based techniques. The fungal diversity obtained from these techniques were different, with 11.1% of the fungal genera shared between both techniques. Through ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer 2 of the rDNA) metabarcode sequencing from 42 sediment samples, 890 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found based on clustering at a 97% sequence similarity cutoff level. Of these OTUs, 98 OTUs belonged to Ascomycota, 52 OTUs to Basidiomycota, 1 OTU to Chytridiomycota, 4 OTUs to Mortierellomycota, 19 OTUs to Mucoromycota and 2 OTUs to Rozellomycota, whereas 714 OTUs could not be assigned to any fungal phylum.

Molecular Ecology Resources Published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is increasingly used for diet analyses; however, it may not always describe diet samples well. A reason for this is that diet samples contain mixtures of food DNA in different amounts as well as consumer DNA which can reduce the food DNA characterized. Because of this, detections will depend on the relative amount and identity of each type of DNA. For such samples, diagnostic PCR will most likely give more reliable results, as detection probability is only marginally dependent on other copresent DNA. We investigated the reliability of each method to test (a) whether predatory beetle regurgitates, supposed to be low in consumer DNA, allow to retrieve prey sequences using general barcoding primers that co-amplify the consumer DNA, and (b) to assess the sequencing depth or replication needed for NGS and diagnostic PCR to give stable results. When consumer DNA is co-amplified, NGS is better suited to discover the range of possible prey, than for comparing co-occurrences of diet species between samples, as retested samples were repeatedly different in prey detections with this approach. This shows that samples were incompletely described, as prey detected by diagnostic PCR frequently were missed by NGS. As the sequencing depth needed to reliably describe the diet in such samples becomes very high, the cost-efficiency and reliability of diagnostic PCR make diagnostic PCR better suited for testing large sample-sets. Especially if the targeted prey taxa are thought to be of ecological importance, as diagnostic PCR gave more nested and consistent results in repeated testing of the same sample.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","DNA barcoding | food web | high-throughput sequencing | metabarcoding | multiplex PCR | prey detection | trophic interactions","11700154306","P26144","Austrian Science Fund","1","TRUE","112","19","2","30506979",NA,NA,NA,2019

Soil fungal communities, bacterial communities, and soil enzymatic repertoires may be variably impacted by different site preparation schemes after disturbance. We compared effects of three rehabilitation schemes on fungal community composition, bacterial community composition, and potential hydrolase activities (N-acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidase, acid phosphatase, and cellobiohydrolase) at two times (14 days and 5 months post-site preparation) and two sampling depths (FFOM/”upper” versus mineral/”lower” soil). We observed declines in FFOM-associated fungal biomass (ergosterol) and declines in ectomycorrhizal fungi abundance across all site rehabilitation schemes compared to intact control plots. Fungal community composition strongly shifted to saprotroph dominance (i.e. increased Mortierella, and Umbelopsis) in rehabilitated plots at 5 months, while bacterial community composition did not distinguish control plots from rehabilitation plots ones at either sampling time. Bacterial saprotrophs previously associated with mycelial necromass colonization were higher in abundance across multiple site preparation regimens compared to control plots at 14 days. Our results indicate that reductions in ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance were a dominant community property in recently reconstructed soil profiles. Increases in bacteria associated with recently deposited fungal necromass were detectable within days to weeks of implementing site rehabilitation, while fungal necromass colonizers became dominant 5 months post-rehabilitation.

Phylogenetic placement methods determine how these sequences fit into an evolutionary context. Previous implementations of phylogenetic placement algorithms, such as the evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA) included in RAxML, or PPLACER, are being increasingly used for this purpose. However, due to the steady progress in NGS technologies, the current implementations face substantial scalability limitations. Herein, we present EPA-NG, a complete reimplementation of the EPA that is substantially faster, offers a distributed memory parallelization, and integrates concepts from both, RAxML-EPA and PPLACER. EPA-NG can be executed on standard shared memory, as well as on distributed memory systems (e.g., computing clusters). To demonstrate the scalability of EPA-NG, we placed 1 billion metagenetic reads from the Tara Oceans Project onto a reference tree with 3748 taxa in just under 7 h, using 2048 cores. Our performance assessment shows that EPA-NG outperforms RAxML-EPA and PPLACER by up to a factor of 30 in sequential execution mode, while attaining comparable parallel efficiency on shared memory systems.

Journal of Ecology © 2018 British Ecological Society  A major goal in microbial ecology is to understand the factors that structure bacterial communities across space and time. For microbes that are plant symbionts, community assembly processes can lead to either a positive or negative relationship between plant size or age and soil microbe diversity. Here, we evaluated the extent to which such relationships exist within a single legume species (Acacia acuminata) and their naturally occurring symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia). We quantified the diversity of rhizobia that associate with A. acuminata trees of variable size spanning a large environmental gradient in southwest Australia (72 trees in 24 sites spread across ~300,000 km 2 ), using metabarcoding. We modelled rhizobia diversity using 16S exact genetic variants, in a binomial multivariate statistical framework that controlled for climate and local soil characteristics. We identified two major phylogenetic clades of rhizobia that associate with A. acuminata. Soil sampled at the base of larger Acacia trees contained a higher richness of rhizobia genetic variants. Each major clade responds differently to environmental factors (climate and soil characteristics), but the positive association between tree size and rhizobia genetic diversity was mainly driven by responses from one of the two clades. Overall tree size explained more variation than any other factor, resulting in a ~3-fold increase in total richness and clade diversity from the smallest to the largest trees. Synthesis. Previous studies have shown that plant host species is important in structuring microbial soil communities in the rhizosphere. Our results show that host size or age within a single plant species can also structure diversity of at least one group of soil microbes. A positive relationship between plant host size and rhizobia diversity suggests that hosts may modify the niche space of their surrounding soil (niche construction hypothesis) enabling a higher richness of microbial taxa. That different rhizobial groups responded differently to host size and other ecological factors suggests that rhizobia is not an ecologically uniform group, and that entirely neutral explanations for our results are unlikely. Host plants may be analogous to “islands,” where larger plant hosts may accumulate diversity over time, through migration opportunities.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","community assembly | community ecology | island biogeography | microbial ecology | mutualism | niche construction | plant–soil (below-ground) interactions | symbiosis","29602","DP110103168","Australian Research Council","0","FALSE","116","107","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Background: High-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) has become a routine tool for biodiversity survey and ecological studies. By including sample-specific tags in the primers prior PCR amplification, it is possible to multiplex hundreds of samples in a single sequencing run. The analysis of millions of sequences spread into hundreds to thousands of samples prompts for efficient, automated yet flexible analysis pipelines. Various algorithms and software have been developed to perform one or multiple processing steps, such as paired-end reads assembly, chimera filtering, Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) clustering and taxonomic assignment. Some of these software are now well established and widely used by scientists as part of their workflow. Wrappers that are capable to process metabarcoding data from raw sequencing data to annotated OTU-to-sample matrix were also developed to facilitate the analysis for non-specialist users. Yet, most of them require basic bioinformatic or command-line knowledge, which can limit the accessibility to such integrative toolkits. Furthermore, for flexibility reasons, these tools have adopted a step-by-step approach, which can prevent an easy automation of the workflow, and hence hamper the analysis reproducibility. Results: We introduce SLIM, an open-source web application that simplifies the creation and execution of metabarcoding data processing pipelines through an intuitive Graphic User Interface (GUI). The GUI interact with well-established software and their associated parameters, so that the processing steps are performed seamlessly from the raw sequencing data to an annotated OTU-to-sample matrix. Thanks to a module-centered organization, SLIM can be used for a wide range of metabarcoding cases, and can also be extended by developers for custom needs or for the integration of new software. The pipeline configuration (i.e. the modules chaining and all their parameters) is stored in a file that can be used for reproducing the same analysis. Conclusion: This web application has been designed to be user-friendly for non-specialists yet flexible with advanced settings and extensibility for advanced users and bioinformaticians.

Like natural enemies, invasive polyphagous pests may respond positively to local and landscape-scale diversity, making them more serious challenges to sustainable management than specialists. Yet the current view of landscape effects on pests rarely considers perennial systems or polyphagous pests. We investigated Drosophila suzukii (SWD) and natural enemy distributions and trophic interactions in blueberry systems of the southeast US in relation to local management and landscape structure. Fields were nested in 1-km landscapes along gradients of crop and forest heterogeneity (landscape compositional diversity) and field border and crop border lengths (landscape configurational diversity). Yeast-sugar bait traps were used to collect SWD and canopy suction sampling for natural enemies. Management practices at the local scale did not influence SWD abundance, but natural enemy abundance was higher in organic systems and fields with vegetation present between rows. Landscape configurational diversity and greater proportion of non-cropping habitat promoted higher SWD populations. Natural enemy communities were composed of highly generalized species, and contrary to our predictions, we observed lower abundances in landscapes with higher proportion of non-cropping area. Few predators were detected to have fed on SWD, and communities were dominated by predators with low specialization on prey in blueberry. Our results indicate that local and landscape features in blueberry landscapes have differential effects on a polyphagous pest and generalist natural enemies. Our initial analysis of predator diets, using a metabarcoding approach, suggests spatial structure in specialization on prey with high diversity of prey in predators collected in forested margins.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Field margin | Habitat management | Landscape configuration | Landscape heterogeneity | Metabarcoding | MGCA | Molecular gut content analysis | Predator-Prey interactions | Vegetation management","15110","GS16-163","Southern SARE","0","FALSE","118","272",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0167880918304699",2019

Bees forage for pollen and nectar at flowers but simultaneously acquire pathogenic, commensal, and likely beneficial microbes from these same flowers. Characterizing pollen usage of wild bees is therefore crucial to their conservation yet remains a challenging task. To understand pollen usage across landscapes and how this affects microbial communities found in the pollen provisions collected from flowers, we studied the generalist small carpenter bee Ceratina australensis. We collected C. australensis nests from three different climatic zones across eastern and southern Australia. To characterize the plant, fungal, and bacterial composition of these pollen provisions, we used a metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing approach. We found that the species richness of plant types, fungi, and bacteria was highest in a subtropical zone compared to a temperate or a grassland zone. The composition of these communities also differentiated by zone, particularly in pollen composition and fungal communities. Moreover, pollen composition strongly correlated with fungal community composition, suggesting that variation in pollen usage across landscapes results in variation in microbial communities.

Distribution patterns of OTUs showed that only 1.5% were present in all reefs, while over half were present in a single reef. On both local and regional scales, the majority of OTUs were rare. The high heterogeneity in community patterns of the reef cryptobiome has implications for reef conservation. Understanding the biodiversity patterns of this critical component of reef functioning will enable a sound knowledge of how coral reefs will respond to future anthropogenic impacts.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Autonomous reef monitoring structures | Coral reefs | Cytochrome oxidase I | EDNA biodiversity | Reef cryptobiome","130030","undefined","Saudi Aramco","1","TRUE","122","286","1896","30963940","20182697","KAUST",NA,2019

Terrestrial arthropods comprise the most species-rich communities on Earth, and grassland flowers provide resources for hundreds of thousands of arthropod species. Diverse grassland ecosystems worldwide are threatened by various types of environmental change, which has led to decline in arthropod diversity. At the same time, monitoring grassland arthropod diversity is time-consuming and strictly dependent on declining taxonomic expertise. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of complex samples has demonstrated that information on species compositions can be efficiently and non-invasively obtained. Here, we test the potential of wild flowers as a novel source of arthropod eDNA. We performed eDNA metabarcoding of flowers from several different plant species using two sets of generic primers, targeting the mitochondrial genes 16S rRNA and COI. Our results show that terrestrial arthropod species leave traces of DNA on the flowers that they interact with. We obtained eDNA from at least 135 arthropod species in 67 families and 14 orders, together representing diverse ecological groups including pollinators, parasitoids, gall inducers, predators, and phytophagous species. Arthropod communities clustered together according to plant species. Our data also indicate that this experiment was not exhaustive, and that an even higher arthropod richness could be obtained using this eDNA approach. Overall, our results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain information on diverse communities of insects and other terrestrial arthropods from eDNA metabarcoding of wild flowers. This novel source of eDNA represents a vast potential for addressing fundamental research questions in ecology, obtaining data on cryptic and unknown species of plant-associated arthropods, as well as applied research on pest management or conservation of endangered species such as wild pollinators.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","arthropods | eDNA | environmental DNA metabarcoding | flowers | grassland | insects | pollinators","26916","undefined","Augustinus Fonden","1","TRUE","123","9","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

DNA extraction from environmental samples (environmental DNA; eDNA) for metabarcoding-based biodiversity studies is gaining popularity as a noninvasive, time-efficient, and cost-effective monitoring tool. The potential benefits are promising for marine conservation, as the marine biome is frequently under-surveyed due to its inaccessibility and the consequent high costs involved. With increasing numbers of eDNA-related publications have come a wide array of capture and extraction methods. Without visual species confirmation, inconsistent use of laboratory protocols hinders comparability between studies because the efficiency of target DNA isolation may vary. We determined an optimal protocol (capture and extraction) for marine eDNA research based on total DNA yield measurements by comparing commonly employed methods of seawater filtering and DNA isolation. We compared metabarcoding results of both targeted (small taxonomic group with species-level assignment) and universal (broad taxonomic group with genus/family-level assignment) approaches obtained from replicates treated with the optimal and a low-performance capture and extraction protocol to determine the impact of protocol choice and DNA yield on biodiversity detection. Filtration through cellulose-nitrate membranes and extraction with Qiagen's DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit outperformed other combinations of capture and extraction methods, showing a ninefold improvement in DNA yield over the poorest performing methods. Use of optimized protocols resulted in a significant increase in OTU and species richness for targeted metabarcoding assays. However, changing protocols made little difference to the OTU and taxon richness obtained using universal metabarcoding assays. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of false-negative species detection for targeted eDNA approaches when protocols with poor DNA isolation efficacy are employed. Appropriate optimization is therefore essential for eDNA monitoring to remain a powerful, efficient, and relatively cheap method for biodiversity assessments. For seawater, we advocate filtration through cellulose-nitrate membranes and extraction with Qiagen's DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit or phenol-chloroform-isoamyl for successful implementation of eDNA multi-marker metabarcoding surveys.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","biodiversity assessment | eDNA | extraction | filtration | metabarcoding","21100264002","LP160101508","Australian Research Council","1","TRUE","125","9","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

High-throughput sequencing has the potential to describe biological communities with high efficiency yet comprehensive assessment of diversity with species-level resolution remains one of the most challenging aspects of metabarcoding studies. We investigated the utility of curated ribosomal and mitochondrial nematode reference sequence databases for determining phylum-specific species-level clustering thresholds. We compiled 438 ribosomal and 290 mitochondrial sequences which identified 99% and 94% as the species delineation clustering threshold, respectively. These thresholds were evaluated in HTS data from mock communities containing 39 nematode species as well as environmental samples from Vietnam. We compared the taxonomic description of the mocks generated by two read-merging and two clustering algorithms and the cluster-free Dada2 pipeline. Taxonomic assignment with the RDP classifier was assessed under different training sets. Our results showed that 36/39 mock nematode species were identified across the molecular markers (18S: 32, JB2: 19, JB3: 21) in UClust_ref OTUs at their respective clustering thresholds, outperforming UParse_denovo and the commonly used 97% similarity. Dada2 generated the most realistic number of ASVs (18S: 83, JB2: 75, JB3: 82), collectively identifying 30/39 mock species. The ribosomal marker outperformed the mitochondrial markers in terms of species and genus-level detections for both OTUs and ASVs. The number of taxonomic assignments of OTUs/ASVs was highest when the smallest reference database containing only nematode sequences was used and when sequences were truncated to the respective amplicon length. Overall, OTUs generated more species-level detections, which were, however, associated with higher error rates compared to ASVs. Genus-level assignments using ASVs exhibited higher accuracy and lower error rates compared to species-level assignments, suggesting that this is the most reliable pipeline for rapid assessment of alpha diversity from environmental samples.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","12","metabarcoding | mock community | Nematoda | reference sequence database | UClust | USearch9","21100264002","G0F2816N","National Foundation for Science and Technology Development","1","TRUE","126","9","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

With our newly developed fusion primer sets for the BF2 + BR2 primer pair up to three 96-well plates (288 wells) can be uniquely tagged for a single Illumina sequencing run. By including Illumina indices, tagging can be extended to thousands of samples.

Ayurveda is one of the oldest systems of medicine in the world, but the growing commercial interest in Ayurveda based products has increased the incentive for adulteration and substitution within this herbal market. Fraudulent practices such as the use of undeclared fillers and use of other species of inferior quality is driven both by the increased as well as insufficient supply capacity of especially wild plant species. Developing novel strategies to exhaustively assess and monitor both the quality of raw materials and final marketed herbal products is a challenge in herbal pharmacovigilance. Seventy-nine Ayurvedic herbal products sold as tablets, capsules, powders, and extracts were randomly purchased via e-commerce and pharmacies across Europe, and DNA metabarcoding was used to assess the ability of this method to authenticate these products. Our analysis reveals that only two out of 12 single ingredient products contained only one species as labeled, eight out of 27 multiple ingredient products contained none of the species listed on the label, and the remaining 19 products contained 1 to 5 of the species listed on the label along with many other species not specified on the label. The fidelity for single ingredient products was 67%, the overall ingredient fidelity for multi ingredient products was 21%, and for all products 24%. The low level of fidelity raises concerns about the reliability of the products, and detection of threatened species raises further concerns about illegal plant trade. The study highlights the necessity for quality control of the marketed herbal products and shows that DNA metabarcoding is an effective analytical approach to authenticate complex multi ingredient herbal products. However, effort needs to be done to standardize the protocols for DNA metabarcoding before this approach can be implemented as routine analytical approaches for plant identification, and approved for use in regulated procedures.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Ayurvedic herbal products | Botanical authentication | DNA barcoding | Herbal medicines | Pharmacovigilance | Quality control","21100313905","undefined","Universitetet i Oslo","1","TRUE","128","10",NA,NA,"68",NA,NA,2019

Environmental DNA (eDNA) is the DNA suspended in the environment (e.g., water column), which includes cells, gametes, and other material derived from but not limited to shedding of tissue, scales, mucus, and fecal matter. Amplifying and sequencing marker genes (i.e., metabarcoding) from eDNA can reveal the wide range of taxa present in an ecosystem through analysis of a single water sample. Metabarcoding of eDNA provides higher resolution data than visual surveys, aiding in assessments of ecosystem health. This study conducted eDNA metabarcoding of two molecular markers (cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes) to survey eukaryotic diversity across multiple trophic levels in surface water samples collected at three sites along the coral reef tract within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) during four research cruises in 2015. The 18S rRNA gene sequences recovered 785 genera while the COI gene sequences recovered 115 genera, with only 33 genera shared between the two datasets, emphasizing the complementarity of these marker genes. Community composition for both genetic markers clustered by month of sample collection, suggesting that temporal variation has a larger effect on biodiversity than spatial variability in the FKNMS surface waters. Sequences from both marker genes were dominated by copepods, but each marker recovered distinct phytoplankton groups, with 18S rRNA gene sequences dominated by dinoflagellates and COI sequences dominated by coccolithophores. Although eDNA samples were collected from surface waters, many benthic species such as sponges, crustaceans, and corals were identified.

Natural history collections provide unique access to samples collected at different spatial and temporal scales. Identification of the plant origins of pollen trapped on the bodies of pollinators in these collections provides insight into historic plant communities and pollinators’ preferred floral taxa. In this study, pollen was sampled from Megachile venusta Smith bees from the National Collection of Insects, South Africa, spanning 93 years. Three barcode regions, the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) and ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), were sequenced from mixed pollen samples using a next-generation sequencing approach (MiSeq, Illumina). Sequenced reads were compared to sequence reference databases that were generated by extracting sequence and taxonomic data from GenBank. ITS1 and ITS2 were amplified successfully across all (or most) samples, while rbcL performed inconsistently. Age of sample had no impact on sequencing success. Plant classification was more informative using ITS2 than ITS1 barcode data. This study also highlights the need for comprehensive reference databases as limited local plant sequence representation in reference databases resulted in higher-level taxon classifications being more confidently interpreted. The results showed that small, insect-carried pollen samples from historic bee specimens collected from as early as 1914 can be used to obtain pollen metabarcodes. DNA metabarcoding of mixed origin pollen samples provided a faster, more accurate method of determining pollen provenance, without the need for expert palynologists. The use of historic collections to sample pollen directly from pollinators provided additional value to these collections. Sampling pollen from historic collections can potentially provide the spatial and temporal scales for investigations into changes in plant community structure or pollinator floral choice in the face of global climate change.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","historic bee specimens | insect collection | ITS | Megachile | palynology | plant–pollinator interaction","19400157205","95649","Department of Science and Technology","1","TRUE","130","12","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Moths are globally relevant as pollinators but nocturnal pollination remains poorly understood. Plant–pollinator interaction networks are traditionally constructed using either flower-visitor observations or pollen-transport detection using microscopy. Recent studies have shown the potential of DNA metabarcoding for detecting and identifying pollen-transport interactions. However, no study has directly compared the realised observations of pollen-transport networks between DNA metabarcoding and conventional light microscopy. 2. Using matched samples of nocturnal moths, we constructed pollen-transport networks using two methods: light microscopy and DNA metabarcoding. Focussing on the feeding mouthparts of moths, we developed and provide reproducible methods for merging DNA metabarcoding and ecological network analysis to better understand species interactions. 3. DNA metabarcoding detected pollen on more individual moths, and detected multiple pollen types on more individuals than microscopy, although the average number of pollen types per individual was unchanged. However, after aggregating individuals of each species, metabarcoding detected more interactions per moth species. Pollen-transport network metrics differed between methods because of variation in the ability of each to detect multiple pollen types per moth and to separate morphologically similar or related pollen. We detected unexpected but plausible moth–plant interactions with metabarcoding, revealing new detail about nocturnal pollination systems. 4. The nocturnal pollination networks observed using metabarcoding and microscopy were similar yet distinct, with implications for network ecologists. Comparisons between networks constructed using metabarcoding and traditional methods should therefore be treated with caution. Nevertheless, the potential applications of metabarcoding for studying plant–pollinator interaction networks are encouraging, especially when investigating understudied pollinators such as moths.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Ecological networks | flowers | Lepidoptera | light microscopy | moths | pollen transport","19779","U074","University of Hull","1","TRUE","131","44","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) are among the most effective nondestructive techniques for sampling bony fishes and elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and skates). However, BRUVs sample visually conspicuous biota; hence, some taxa are undersampled or not recorded at all. We compared the diversity of fishes characterized using BRUVs with diversity detected via environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding. We sampled seawater and captured BRUVs imagery at 48 locales that included reef and seagrass beds inside and outside a marine reserve (Jurien Bay in Western Australia). Eighty-two fish genera from 13 orders were detected, and the community of fishes described using eDNA and BRUVs combined yielded >30% more generic richness than when either method was used alone. Rather than detecting a homogenous genetic signature, the eDNA assemblages mirrored the BRUVs’ spatial explicitness; differentiation of taxa between seagrass and reef was clear despite the relatively small geographical scale of the study site (~35 km 2 ). Taxa that were not sampled by one approach, due to limitations and biases intrinsic to the method, were often detected with the other. Therefore, using BRUVs and eDNA in concert provides a more holistic view of vertebrate marine communities across habitats. Both methods are noninvasive, which enhances their potential for widespread implementation in the surveillance of marine ecosystems.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","ADN ambiental | baited remote underwater video systems | elasmobranchs | elasmobranquios | environmental DNA | environmental genomics | genómica ambiental | manejo marino | marine management | sistemas remotos de video submarino con carnada","17822","LP160100839","M.S.I.

We built a detailed census of the whole soil biota in a 12-ha tropical forest plot using soil DNA metabarcoding. We show that the distribution of 19 taxonomic groups (ranging from microbes to mesofauna) is primarily stochastic, suggesting that neutral processes are prominent drivers of the assembly of these communities at this scale. We also identify aluminium, topography and plant species identity as weak, yet significant drivers of soil richness and community composition of bacteria, protists and to a lesser extent fungi. Finally, we show that body size, which determines the scale at which an organism perceives its environment, predicted the community assembly across taxonomic groups, with soil mesofauna assemblages being more stochastic than microbial ones. These results suggest that the relative contribution of neutral processes and environmental selection to community assembly directly depends on body size.

However, existing knowledge on Amazonian biodiversity and its environmental determinants stems almost exclusively from studies of macroscopic above-ground organisms, notably vertebrates and trees. In contrast, diversity patterns of most other organisms remain elusive, although some of them, for instance microorganisms, constitute the overwhelming majority of taxa in any given location, both in terms of diversity and abundance. Here, we use DNA metabarcoding to estimate prokaryote and eukaryote diversity in environmental soil and litter samples from 39 survey plots in a longitudinal transect across Brazilian Amazonia using 16S and 18S gene sequences, respectively. We characterize richness and community composition based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and test their correlation with longitude and habitat. We find that prokaryote and eukaryote OTU richness and community composition differ significantly among localities and habitats, and that prokaryotes are more strongly structured by locality and habitat type than eukaryotes. Our results 1) provide a first large-scale mapping of Amazonian soil biodiversity, suggesting that OTU richness patterns might follow substantially different patterns from those observed for macro-organisms; and 2) indicate that locality and habitat factors interact in determining OTU richness patterns and community composition.

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Predator–prey relationships are important ecological interactions, affecting biotic community composition and energy flow through a system, and are of interest to ecologists and managers. Morphological diet analysis has been the primary method used to quantify the diets of predators, but emerging molecular techniques using genetic data can provide more accurate estimates of relative diet composition. This study used sequences from the 18S V9 rRNA barcoding region to identify prey items in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of predatory fishes. Predator GI samples were taken from the Black River, Cheboygan Co., MI, USA (n = 367 samples, 12 predator species) during periods of high prey availability, including the larval stage of regionally threatened lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens Rafinesque 1817) in late May/early June of 2015 and of relatively lower prey availability in early July of 2015. DNA was extracted and sequenced from 355 samples (96.7%), and prey DNA was identified in 286 of the 355 samples (80.6%). Prey were grouped into 33 ecologically significant taxonomic groups based on the lowest taxonomic level sequences that could be identified using sequences available on GenBank. Changes in the makeup of diet composition, dietary overlap, and predator preference were analyzed comparing the periods of high and low prey abundance. Some predator species exhibited significant seasonal changes in diet composition. Dietary overlap was slightly but significantly higher during the period of high prey abundance; however, there was little change in predator preference. This suggests that change in prey availability was the driving factor in changing predator diet composition and dietary overlap. This study demonstrates the utility of molecular diet analysis and how temporal variability in community composition adds complexity to predator–prey interactions.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","diet composition | dietary overlap | freshwater fish | larval fishes | macroinvertebrates | temporal variability","21100264002","undefined","AgBioResearch, Michigan State University","1","TRUE","136","9","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Tropical forests have long fascinated ecologists, inspiring a plethora of research into the mechanisms regulating their immense biodiversity, which originally captured the interests of early natural historians and explorers, and that still persists to this day. A new focus of this research emerged in the early 2000s highlighting the potential role of neutral (stochastic) processes in regulating the composition and diversity of tropical forest communities, and thus the maintenance of a large portion of global biodiversity (Hubbell, 2001). This strictly contrasted the long-held belief that communities assembled via the sorting of species (and their abundances) via a deterministic response to local abiotic and biotic environmental conditions, reflecting the niche of each species (Leibold & McPeek, 2006). Yet, it is unlikely that the assembly of any community is solely governed by either stochastic or deterministic processes, but instead a combination of both. However, whether deterministic processes via nichebased environmental sorting of species, or stochastic processes reflecting pattens of dispersal limitation, neutral effects and ecological drift dominate is often unclear. This prompts questions as to whether the relative influence of one process over another is dependent on the scale (spatial or temporal) or context of the study, or specific traits of the taxa under investigation (e.g., body size). In a From the Cover paper in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Zinger et al. (2018) tackle all these issues and show, among other things, that for soil microbes and mesofauna from tropical forests, the relative contribution of stochastic and deterministic processes in assembling their communities is strongly dependent on the body size or the studied taxa.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","1","Body size | DNA metabarcoding | Extracellular DNA | Metabolic theory of ecology | Neutral theory | Next generation sequencing | Niche differentiation | Soil biodiversity","20297","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","137","28","3","30793869",NA,NA,NA,2019

The study of protistan functional diversity is crucial to understand the dynamics of oceanic ecological processes. We combined the metabarcoding data of various coastal ecosystems and a newly developed trait-based approach to study the link between taxonomic and functional diversity across marine protistan communities of different size-classes. Environmental DNA was extracted and the V4 18S rDNA genomic region was amplified and sequenced. In parallel, we tried to annotate the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from our metabarcoding dataset to 30 biological traits using published and accessible information on protists. We then developed a method to study trait correlations across protists (i.e. trade-offs) in order to build the best functional groups. Based on the annotated OTUs and our functional groups, we demonstrated that the functional diversity of marine protist communities varied in parallel with their taxonomic diversity. The coupling between functional and taxonomic diversity was conserved across different protist size classes. However, the smallest size-fraction was characterized by wider taxonomic and functional groups diversity, corroborating the idea that nanoplankton and picoplankton are part of a more stable ecological background on which larger protists and metazoans might develop.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","9",NA,"19683","EC2CO","Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","0","FALSE","138","21","2","30672084",NA,NA,NA,2019

Remane's Artenminimum at the horohalinicum is a fundamental concept in ecology to describe and explain the distribution of organisms along salinity gradients. However, a recent metadata analysis challenged this concept for protists, proposing a species maximum in brackish waters. Due to data bias, this literature-based investigation was highly discussed. Reliable data verifying or rejecting the species minimum for protists in brackish waters were critically lacking. Here, we sampled a pronounced salinity gradient along a west–east transect in the Baltic Sea and analysed protistan plankton communities using high-throughput eDNA metabarcoding. A strong salinity barrier at the upper limit of the horohalinicum and 10 psu appeared to select for significant shifts in protistan community structures, with dinoflagellates being dominant at lower salinities, and dictyochophytes and diatoms being keyplayers at higher salinities. Also in vertical water column gradients in deeper basins (Kiel Bight, Arkona and Bornholm Basin) appeared salinity as significant environmental determinant influencing alpha- and beta-diversity patterns. Importantly, alpha-diversity indices revealed species maxima in brackish waters, that is, indeed contrasting Remane's Artenminimum concept. Statistical analyses confirmed salinity as the major driving force for protistan community structuring with high significance. This suggests that macrobiota and microbial eukaryotes follow fundamentally different rules regarding diversity patterns in the transition zone from freshwater to marine waters.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"19683","185","Scioto Foundation","0","FALSE","139","21","2","30548156",NA,NA,NA,2019

Stormwater infiltration systems (SIS) have been developed to limit surface runoff and flooding in urban areas. The impacts of such practices on the ecological and biological quality of groundwater ecosystems remain poorly studied due to the lack of efficient methodologies to assess microbiological quality of aquifers. In the present study, a monitoring method based on the incubation of artificial matrices (clay beads) is presented to evaluate microbial biomass, microbial activities, and bacterial community structure. Four microbial variables (biomass, dehydrogenase and hydrolytic activities, bacterial community structures) were measured on clay beads incubated in three urban water types (stormwater surface runoffs, SIS-impacted and non-impacted groundwaters) for six SIS. Analyses based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) of partial rrs (16S rRNA) PCR products (V5-V6) were used to compare bacterial community structures of biofilms on clay beads after 10 days of incubation with those of waters collected from the same sampling points at three occasions. Biofilm biomass and activities on clay beads were indicative of nutrient transfers from surface to SIS-impacted groundwaters. Biofilms allowed impacts of SIS on groundwater bacterial community structures to be determined. Although bacterial communities on clay beads did not perfectly match those of waters, clay beads captured the most abundant bacterial taxa. They also captured bacterial taxa that were not detected in waters collected at three occasions during the incubation, demonstrating the integrative character of this approach. Monitoring biofilms on clay beads also allowed the tracking of bacterial genera containing species representing health concerns.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","16S rRNA | Environmental monitoring | Infiltration basins | Metabarcoding | Microbial biomass and activity | Next generation sequencing (NGS)","21482","EST 2016/1/120","Agence Nationale de la Recherche","0","FALSE","140","191","2","30627788","58",NA,NA,2019

Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an emerging biological monitoring tool that can aid in assessing the effects of forestry and forest manufacturing activities on biota. Monitoring taxa across broad spatial and temporal scales is necessary to ensure forest management and forest manufacturing activities meet their environmental goals of maintaining biodiversity. Our objectives are to describe potential applications of eDNA across the wood products supply chain extending from regenerating forests, harvesting, and wood transport, to manufacturing facilities, and to review the current state of the science in this context. To meet our second objective, we summarize the taxa examined with targeted (PCR, qPCR or ddPCR) or metagenomic eDNA methods (eDNA metabarcoding), evaluate how estimated species richness compares between traditional field sampling and eDNA metabarcoding approaches, and compare the geographical representation of prior eDNA studies in freshwater ecosystems to global wood baskets. Potential applications of eDNA include evaluating the effects of forestry and forest manufacturing activities on aquatic biota, delineating fish-bearing versus non fish-bearing reaches, evaluating effectiveness of constructed road crossings for freshwater organism passage, and determining the presence of at-risk species. Studies using targeted eDNA approaches focused on fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, while metagenomic studies focused on fish, invertebrates, and microorganisms. Rare, threatened, or endangered species received the least attention in targeted eDNA research, but are arguably of greatest interest to sustainable forestry and forest manufacturing that seek to preserve freshwater biodiversity. Ultimately, using eDNA methods will enable forestry and forest manufacturing managers to have data-driven prioritization for conservation actions for all freshwater species.","1","Journal","re","Review","100","6","Biodiversity | Environmental DNA | Metagenomics | Pulp and paper","25349","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","141","649",NA,"30308887",NA,NA,"S0048969718333412",2019

Storm disturbance has a huge impact on subalpine forest ecosystems. Evaluating the long-term effects and mechanisms of storm disturbance is of great significance for conservation of subalpine forests as frequency and intensity of storms are increasing because of the climate change. Species of subalpine conifer tree genera such as Picea and Tsuga need coarse woody debris (CWD) such as logs and stumps for seedling colonization; thus, their establishment is greatly affected by the condition of CWD, which largely depends on the activity of fungal decomposer communities and saproxylic bryophyte communities. Because the process of CWD decay and associated ecological succession is known to take several decades in subalpine forests, we hypothesized that storm disturbance has long-lasting effects on fungal communities, their wood decay function, saproxylic bryophyte communities, and seedling establishment. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed fungal, bryophyte, and seedling communities at forest sites that had been disturbed by a large typhoon 55 years ago and compared them with those of surrounding undisturbed coniferous forest in central Japan. Contrary to our hypothesis, Illumina sequencing for the fungal ITS1 region in rDNA obtained from wood samples did not show that past disturbance had an obvious effect on current fungal communities. Also, the frequencies of occurrence of various wood decay types were not significantly different between disturbed and undisturbed plots. However, disturbance affected bryophyte communities, which had strong effects on the seedling densities of Picea jezoensis var. hondoensis, Tsuga diversifolia, and Betula spp. These results suggest that the previous typhoon disturbance in the focal area had long-lasting effects on biotic interactions and seedling regeneration on CWD, but these effects might not be attributable to the impacts of disturbance on CWD fungal communities and their wood decay function.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Blowdown | Dead wood | Decomposition | DNA metabarcoding | Log | Species interaction","25720","26850093","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","0","FALSE","145","432",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0378112718312696",2019

To investigate how soil fungi is affected by the vegetation transition from spruce to beech forest, we sampled litter, humus and mineral soil in a forest landscape dominated by beech, spruce or a mixture of these. The fungal communities in the soil samples were analyzed by DNA metabarcoding of the rDNA ITS2 region. Although soil layers were the most important structuring gradient, we found clear differences in fungal species composition between spruce and beech plots. The differences in fungal community composition were most evident in the litter and least in the mineral soil. Decomposers, most notably Mycena, dominated the litter layer while various mycorrhizal fungi dominated the humus and mineral layers.

Terrestrial plants including forest trees are generally known to live in close association with microbial organisms. The inherent features of this close association can be commensalism, parasitism or mutualism. The term ""microbiota"" has been used to describe this ecological community of plant-associated pathogenic, mutualistic, endophytic and commensal microorganisms. Many of these microbiota inhabiting forest trees could have a potential impact on the health of, and disease progression in, forest biomes. Comparatively, studies on forest tree microbiomes and their roles in mutualism and disease lag far behind parallel work on crop and human microbiome projects. Very recently, our understanding of plant and tree microbiomes has been enriched due to novel technological advances using metabarcoding, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics approaches. In addition, the availability of massive DNA databases (e.g., NCBI (USA), EMBL (Europe), DDBJ (Japan), UNITE (Estonia)) as well as powerful computational and bioinformatics tools has helped to facilitate data mining by researchers across diverse disciplines. Available data demonstrate that plant phyllosphere bacterial communities are dominated by members of only a few phyla (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes). In bulk forest soil, the dominant fungal group is Basidiomycota, whereas Ascomycota is the most prevalent group within plant tissues. The current challenge, however, is how to harness and link the acquired knowledge on microbiomes for translational forest management. Among tree-associated microorganisms, endophytic fungal biota are attracting a lot of attention for their beneficial health- and growth-promoting effects, and were preferentially discussed in this review.","0","Journal","re","Review","100","4","Endophytes | Forest trees | Fungi | Microbiome | Microbiota","21100219934","undefined","Georg-August-Universität Göttingen","1","TRUE","147","10","1",NA,"42","GAU",NA,2019

We newly tested 16S V4 metabarcoding on endolithic portions of mesophtic rhodoliths exhibiting low phototroph colonization that revealed a hidden, cryptic algal diversity targeting spores, propagules, and unsuspected life history stages. We explored cryo-SEM as a potentially more informative method than regular SEM to minimize artifacts of sample preparation in the study of endolithic cell inclusions which brought to light a suite of microalgal stages. We were able to differentiate floridean starch from cellular inclusions. We associated the effect of anatomical growth pattern on presence or absence of cellular inclusions in biogenic rhodoliths. Analyses of combined 16S V4 metabarcodes and 16S Sanger sequences of two red algal orders, the Halymeniales and Bonnemaisoniales, increased the established record of diversity in the region.

Ever-faster rates of urbanization have led to the substantial loss of agricultural land and natural areas. Furthermore, vegetated land is often fragmented and dominated by nonnative plant species within urban areas, which is likely to impact plant-pollinator interactions. However, the study of plant-pollinator interactions is labor intensive and remains challenging. Here, we compared plant species visited by honeybees in urban versus non-urban sites, using metabarcoding to identify pollen in honey samples. We identified a total of 262 plant genera, 15 of which were represented predominantly. Samples varied greatly in terms of plant composition, the number of nonnative genera and the number of crop plant genera. Even though land cover differed between urban and non-urban sites, plant diversity in the honey did not.

The rapid loss of biodiversity, coupled with difficulties in species identification, call for innovative approaches to assess biodiversity. Insects make up a substantial proportion of extant diversity and play fundamental roles in any given ecosystem. To complement morphological species identification, new techniques such as metabarcoding make it possible to quantify insect diversity and insect-ecosystem interactions through DNA sequencing. Here we examine the potential of bulk insect samples (i.e., containing many non-sorted specimens) to assess prokaryote and eukaryote biodiversity and to complement the taxonomic coverage of soil samples. We sampled 25 sites on three continents and in various ecosystems, collecting insects with SLAM traps (Brazil) and Malaise traps (South Africa and Sweden). We then compared our diversity estimates with the results obtained with biodiversity data from soil samples from the same localities. We found a largely different taxonomic composition between the soil and insect samples, testifying to the potential of bulk insect samples to complement soil samples. Finally, we found that non-destructive DNA extraction protocols, which preserve insect specimens for morphological studies, constitute a promising choice for cost-effective biodiversity assessments.

Metabarcoding is a powerful, increasingly popular tool for biodiversity assessment, but it still suffers from some drawbacks (specimen destruction, separation, and size sorting). In the present study, we tested a non-destructive protocol that excludes any sample sorting, where the ethanol used for sample preserving is filtered and DNA is extracted from the filter for subsequent DNA metabarcoding. When tested on macroinvertebrate mock communities, the method was widely successful but was unable to reliably detect mollusc taxa. Three different protocols (no treatment, shaking, and freezing) were successfully applied to increase DNA release to the fixative. The protocols resulted in similar success in taxa detection (6.8-7 taxa) but differences in read numbers assigned to taxa of interest (33.8%-93.7%). In comparison to conventional bulk sample metabarcoding of environmental samples, taxa with pronounced exoskeleton and small-bodied taxa were especially underrepresented in ethanol samples. For EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) taxa, which are important for determining stream ecological status, the methods detected 46 OTUs in common, with only 4 unique to the ethanol samples and 10 to the bulk samples. These results indicate that fixative-based metabarcoding is a non-destructive, time-saving alternative for biodiversity assessments focussing on taxa used for ecological status determination. However, for a comprehensive assessment on total invertebrate biodiversity, the method may not be sufficient, and conventional bulk sample metabarcoding should be applied.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Environmental DNA | Macroinvertebrates | Metabarcoding | Non-destructive","22211","01LI1501","Swiss Barcode Of Life","1","TRUE","155","62","3","30457888",NA,NA,NA,2019

In the last decade, eDNA and metabarcoding have opened new avenues to biodiversity studies; amphibians and reptiles are animals for which these new approaches have allowed great leaps forward. Here we review different approaches through which eDNA can be used to study amphibians, reptiles and many more organisms. eDNA is often used to evaluate the presence of target species in freshwaters; it has been particularly useful to detect invasive alien amphibians and secretive or rare species, but the metabarcoding approach is increasingly used as a cost-effective approach to assess entire communities. There is growing evidence that eDNA can be also useful to study terrestrial organisms, to evaluate the relative abundance of species, and to detect reptiles. Metabarcoding has also revolutionized studies on the microbiome associated to skin and gut, clarifying the complex relationships between pathogens, microbial diversity and environmental variation. We also identify additional aspects that have received limited attention so far, but can greatly benefit from innovative applications of eDNA, such as the study of past biodiversity, diet analysis and the reconstruction of trophic interactions. Despite impressive potential, eDNA and metabarcoding also bear substantial technical and analytical complexity; we identify laboratory and analytical strategies that can improve the robustness of results. Collaboration among field biologists, ecologist, molecular biologists, and bioinformaticians is allowing fast technical and conceptual advances; multidisciplinary studies involving eDNA analyses will greatly improve our understanding of the complex relationships between organisms, and our effectiveness in assessing and preventing the impact of human activities.","0","Journal","re","Review","100","3","Cost effectiveness | Detection probability | Diet | DNA metabarcoding | High-throughput sequencing Microbiome | Pathogens | QPCR","24137","772284","Georgia Forestry Foundation","0","FALSE","156","40","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Bee populations are currently undergoing severe global declines driven by the interactive effects of a number of factors. Ongoing urbanisation has the potential to exacerbate bee declines, unless steps are taken to ensure appropriate floral resources are available. Sown wildflower strips are one way in which floral resources can be provided to urban bees. However, the use of these strips by pollinators in urban environments remains little studied. Here, we employ pollen metabarcoding of the rbcL gene to compare the foraging patterns of different bee species observed using urban sown wildflower strips in July 2016, with a goal of identifying which plant species are most important for bees. We also demonstrate the use of a non-destructive method of pollen collection. Bees were found to forage on a wide variety of plant genera and families, including a diverse range of plants from outside the wildflower plots, suggesting that foragers visiting sown wildflower strips also utilize other urban habitats. Particular plants within the wildflower strips dominated metabarcoding data, particularly Papaver rhoeas and Phacelia tanacetifolia.

Plants are widely used for food and beverage preparation, most often in the form of complex mixtures of dried and ground parts, such as teas, spices or herbal medicines. Quality control of such products is important due to the potential health risks from the presence of unlabelled components or absence of claimed ones. A promising approach to analyse such products is DNA metabarcoding due to its high resolution and sensitivity. However, this method’s application in food analysis requires several methodology optimizations in DNA extraction, amplification and library preparation. In this study, we present such optimizations. The most important methodological outcomes are the following: 1) the DNA extraction method greatly influences amplification success; 2) the main problem for the application of metabarcoding is DNA purity, not integrity or quantity; and 3) the “non-amplifiable” samples can be amplified with polymerases resistant to inhibitors. Using this optimized workflow, we analysed a broad set of plant products (teas, spices and herbal remedies) using two NGS platforms. The analysis revealed the problem of both the presence of extraneous components and the absence of labelled ones. Notably, for teas, no correlation was found between the price and either the absence of labelled components or presence of unlabelled ones; for spices, a negative correlation was found between the price and presence of unlabelled components.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","Food safety | Herbal medicine | High-throughput sequencing | ITS1 | Metabarcoding | Spice | Tea","19700188368","14.609 21.0101","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation","1","TRUE","159","10","2",NA,"122",NA,NA,2019

From this data, species presence can be determined, and overall biodiversity assessed. It is an interdisciplinary method that brings together traditional field-based ecology with in-depth molecular methods and advanced computational tools. As an emerging monitoring method, there are many pitfalls and roadblocks to be considered and avoided, but the method may still have the ability to revolutionize modern biodiversity surveys for the molecular era.

Spores or microscopic stages of macroalgae are present on rocky substrata in shallow waters and even on barrens. The components of such a “macroalgal seed bank” can influence the restoration of macroalgal beds from urchin barrens. Previously, we characterized “macroalgal seed banks” on cobbles collected from the barren bottom by incubation in herbivore-free enriched seawater, which required a few months. Herein, we attempted rapid detection of the macroalgal seed banks by employing DNA metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing of the plastid rbcL partial gene (688 bp). A total of 24 cobbles were collected from three depths (2, 4, and 6 m) of macroalgal beds and urchin barrens in northeastern Kyushu, Japan. Organisms attached on the cobbles were scraped off and suspended in sterilized seawater, after which DNA was extracted. Samples were sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing, and chimera identification and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking were conducted following program and manual based protocols. The combined approach identified 133 OTUs; of these, 102 and 31 OTUs were assigned to 14 orders in Rhodophyta and 5 orders in Phaeophyceae, respectively. Macroalgal beds and urchin barrens showed significant differences in seed bank composition based on PERMANOVA (F = 3.011, p = 0.0059). Seed banks of macroalgal beds predominantly comprised Diplura spp. (Ishigeales familia incertae sedis) (36.6%), Halymeniaceae (17.2%), Gigartinaceae (13.5%), and Peyssonneliaceae (13.2%), while urchin barrens predominantly comprised Halymeniaceae (46.6%) and Diplura spp. (23.6%).

The dominant taxon found by metabarcoding was also Agavoideae, but a broader diversity of plant species was also detected, many of which are likely ""by-catch"" from the broader environment. Metabarcoding outcomes differed between sample types, likely because pollen-swabs measured the plant species visited by bats and guano samples measured all items consumed in the bat's diet, even those that were not pollen or nectar.

While insect migration is suspected to represent a natural phenomenon of major importance, remarkably little is known about it, except for a few flagship species. The reason for this situation is mainly due to technical limitations in the study of insect movement. Here, we propose using metabarcoding of pollen carried by insects as a method for tracking their migrations. We developed a flexible and simple protocol allowing efficient multiplexing and not requiring DNA extraction, one of the most time-consuming part of metabarcoding protocols, and apply this method to the study of the long-distance migration of the butterfly Vanessa cardui, an emerging model for insect migration. We collected 47 butterfly samples along the Mediterranean coast of Spain in spring and performed metabarcoding of pollen collected from their bodies to test for potential arrivals from the African continent. In total, we detected 157 plant species from 23 orders, most of which (82.8%) were insect-pollinated. Taxa present in Africa–Arabia represented 73.2% of our data set, and 19.1% were endemic to this region, strongly supporting the hypothesis that migratory butterflies colonize southern Europe from Africa in spring. Moreover, our data suggest that a northwards trans-Saharan migration in spring is plausible for early arrivals (February) into Europe, as shown by the presence of Saharan floristic elements. Our results demonstrate the possibility of regular insect-mediated transcontinental pollination, with potential implications for ecosystem functioning, agriculture and plant phylogeography.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","insect migration | pollen metabarcoding | pollination | Sahara | Vanessa cardui","11700154306","WW1-300R-18","National Geographic Society","0","FALSE","165","19","1","30267472",NA,NA,NA,2019

Recently, the successful detection of prey DNA from the guts of leeches has raised the possibility that these, and other blood-feeding invertebrates, might serve as useful samplers of mammals. Yet little is known about whether sympatric leech species differ in their feeding preferences, and whether this has a bearing on their relative suitability for monitoring local mammalian diversity. To address these questions, we collected spatially matched samples of two congeneric leech species Haemadipsa picta and Haemadipsa sumatrana from lowland rainforest in Borneo. For each species, we pooled ~500 leeches into batches of 10 individuals, performed PCR to target a section of the mammalian 16S rRNA locus and undertook sequencing of amplicon libraries using an Illumina MiSeq. In total, we identified sequences from 14 mammalian genera, spanning nine families and five orders. We found greater numbers of detections, and higher diversity of OTUs, in H. picta compared with H. sumatrana, with rodents only present in the former leech species. However, comparison of samples from across the landscape revealed no significant difference in mammal community composition between the leech species. We therefore suggest that H. picta is the more suitable iDNA sampler in this degraded Bornean forest. We conclude that the choice of invertebrate sampler can influence the detectability of different mammal groups and that this should be accounted for when designing iDNA studies.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","biodiversity | Borneo | Haemadipsidae | invertebrate-derived DNA | mammals | metabarcoding","11700154306","DFF 5051-00140","Det Frie Forskningsråd","1","TRUE","166","19","1","30225935",NA,NA,NA,2019

Since unpicking the diet of many organisms is unattainable using traditional morphology-based approaches, the application of high-throughput sequencing methods represents a rapid and powerful way forward. Here, we assessed the application of DNA metabarcoding with nearly universal primers for the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c oxidase I in defining the trophic ecology of adult brown shrimp, Crangon crangon, in six European estuaries. The exact trophic role of this abundant and widespread coastal benthic species is somewhat controversial, while information on geographical variation remains scant. Results revealed a highly opportunistic behaviour. Shrimp stomach contents contained hundreds of taxa (>1,000 molecular operational taxonomic units), of which 291 were identified as distinct species, belonging to 35 phyla. Only twenty ascertained species had a mean relative abundance of more than 0.5%. Predominant species included other abundant coastal and estuarine taxa, including the shore crab Carcinus maenas and the amphipod Corophium volutator. Jacobs’ selectivity index estimates based on DNA extracted from both shrimp stomachs and sediment samples were used to assess the shrimp's trophic niche indicating a generalist diet, dominated by crustaceans, polychaetes and fish. Spatial variation in diet composition, at regional and local scales, confirmed the highly flexible nature of this trophic opportunist. Furthermore, the detection of a prevalent, possibly endoparasitic fungus (Purpureocillium lilacinum) in the shrimp's stomach demonstrates the wide range of questions that can be addressed using metabarcoding, towards a more robust reconstruction of ecological networks.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","community ecology | crustaceans | diet analysis | environmental DNA | food webs | metabarcoding","20297","NE/N005759/1","University of Salford Manchester","1","TRUE","167","28","2","30276912",NA,NA,NA,2019

We investigated the impacts of DNA extraction methodology and multiple PCRs on DNA metabarcoding biodiversity estimates for multiple taxonomic groups in soil. We applied four DNA extraction methods with different size constraints in parallel to fixed volumes of soil from a pair of forest sites, followed by sets of ten individually indexed PCRs and Illumina sequencing of prokaryote (16S) and eukaryote (18S, fungal 26S, and metazoan cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) barcodes. Methods utilizing larger soil volumes resulted in higher biodiversity estimates for arthropods but not for prokaryotes or microeukaryotes, and improved spatial discrimination of metazoan communities but not prokaryotes. Each DNA extraction method resulted in a biased community composition, and these biases were consistent across sites and amplicons. Some 36%–41% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were shared between all four DNA extraction methods and OTUs from many phyla had contrasting abundances from different methods. From 0.2% to 19% of OTUs, accounting for 9.4% to 97% of sequence reads, were amplified in all 10 PCRs from each DNA extraction method and sample. OTUs detected in only a single PCR accounted for 26% to 41% of OTUs but only 0.3% to 2.8% of the sequence reads from each extraction method and sample. The inferred species richness increased strongly with the number of PCRs carried out. We conclude that a consistent DNA extraction method should be used for comparisons between samples, confirm that larger samples of soil (=15 g) should be used for analyses of metazoan biodiversity than for microbes, and that the number of PCR replicates undertaken strongly affects species richness estimates.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","DNA extraction | eukaryotes | metabarcoding | metazoans | PCR replicates | prokaryotes | soil biodiversity","21100217611","undefined","University of Auckland","1","TRUE","168","10","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Phytotelmata, such as those found in carnivorous plants, are isolated aquatic communities and thus form a good model for the study of replicated food webs. Due to the degraded nature of the prey, molecular techniques provide a useful tool to study these communities. We studied the pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea L. in allochthonous populations along an elevational gradient in the Alps and Jura. We predicted that invertebrate richness in the contents of the pitcher plants would decrease with increasing elevation, reflecting harsher environmental conditions. Using metabarcoding of the COI gene, we sequenced the invertebrate contents of these pitcher plants.

We tested the quantitative and qualitative robustness of metabarcoding in constructed pollen mixtures varying in species richness (1–9 species), taxonomic relatedness (within genera to across class) and rarity (5%–100% of grains), using Illumina MiSeq with the markers rbcL and ITS2. Qualitatively, species composition determinations were largely correct, but false positives and negatives occurred. False negatives were typically driven by lack of a barcode gap or rarity in a sample. Species richness and taxonomic relatedness, however, did not strongly impact correct determinations. False positives were likely driven by contamination, chimeric sequences and/or misidentification by the bioinformatics pipeline. Quantitatively, the proportion of reads for each species was only weakly correlated with its relative abundance, in contrast to suggestions from some other studies. Quantitative mismatches are not correctable by consistent scaling factors, but instead are context-dependent on the other species present in a sample.

This study addresses these issues using the European free-tailed bat Tadarida teniotis, involving high-throughput sequencing of a small fragment of the COI gene in 15 separate faecal pellets and a 15-pellet pool per each of 20 bats. We investigated how diet descriptors were affected by variability among (a) individuals, (b) pellets of each individual and (c) PCRs of each pellet. In addition, we investigated the impact of (d) analysing separate pellets vs. pellet pools. We found that diet diversity estimates increased steadily with the number of pellets analysed per individual, with seven pellets required to detect ~80% of prey species. Most variation in diet composition was associated with differences among individual bats, followed by pellets per individual and PCRs per pellet. The accuracy of frequency of occurrence estimates increased with the number of pellets analysed per bat, with the highest error rates recorded for prey consumed infrequently by many individuals. Pools provided poor estimates of diet diversity and frequency of occurrence, which were comparable to analysing a single pellet per individual, and consistently missed the less common prey items. Overall, our results stress that maximizing biological replication is critical in dietary metabarcoding studies and emphasize that analysing several samples per individual rather than pooled samples produce more accurate results.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","bat ecology | metabarcoding | molecular diet analyses | replication | sampling design | trophic ecology","20297","668981","Horizon 2020","1","TRUE","171","28","2","29940083",NA,NA,NA,2019

Tropical reefs are highly diverse ecosystems, and reliable biomonitoring, through diet metabarcoding, is needed to understand present and future trophic relationships in this changing habitat. Several studies have assessed the reliability and effectiveness of single molecular markers; however, a cross-marker validation has rarely been performed. This study identified crucial properties for 12S rDNA, 16S rDNA and COI metabarcoding in tropical-reef piscivores (Plectropomus spp.). In addition, three new versatile primer sets for 16S were designed in silico for metabarcoding of reef fish. Results showed that COI was overall better at recovering true diversity because of a well-supported database. Second, optimal 16S amplicon sizes ranged between 160 and 440 base pairs for full diversity recovery, with increased species detection for the 270-base pairs region. Finally, blocking of predator-specific COI sequences was not equally effective in all host species, potentially introducing bias when diet compositions are directly compared. In conclusion, this novel study showed that marker success for prey identification is highly dependent on the reference database, taxonomic scope, DNA quality, amplicon length and sequencing platform. Results suggest that COI, complemented with 16S, yields the best outcome for diet metabarcoding in reef piscivores.

For this purpose, we studied the diet of feather mites using two complementary methods. First, we used light microscopy to examine the gut contents of 1,300 individual feather mites representing 100 mite genera (18 families) from 190 bird species belonging to 72 families and 19 orders. Second, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and DNA metabarcoding to determine gut contents from 1,833 individual mites of 18 species inhabiting 18 bird species.

Diatoms and plant matter appeared as rare food resources for feather mites. Importantly, we did not find any evidence of feather mites feeding upon bird resources (e.g., blood, skin) other than potentially uropygial gland oil. In addition, we found a high prevalence of both keratinophilic and pathogenic fungal taxa in the feather mite species examined. Altogether, our results shed light on the long-standing question of the nature of the relationship between birds and their vane-dwelling feather mites, supporting previous evidence for a commensalistic–mutualistic role of feather mites, which are revealed as likely fungivore–microbivore–detritivore symbionts of bird feathers.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","bacteria | birds | diet | DNA metabarcoding | ecological interactions | feather mites | fungi | high-throughput sequencing | interactions | symbionts","20297","SEV-2012-0262","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","1","TRUE","173","28","2","29726053",NA,NA,NA,2019

Molecular Ecology Resources Published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Implementing cost-effective monitoring programs for wild bees remains challenging due to the high costs of sampling and specimen identification. To reduce costs, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods have lately been suggested as alternatives to morphology-based identifications. To provide a comprehensive presentation of the advantages and weaknesses of different NGS-based identification methods, we assessed three of the most promising ones, namely metabarcoding, mitogenomics and NGS barcoding. Using a regular monitoring data set (723 specimens identified using morphology), we found that NGS barcoding performed best for both species presence/absence and abundance data, producing only few false positives (3.4%) and no false negatives. In contrast, the proportion of false positives and false negatives was higher using metabarcoding and mitogenomics. Although strong correlations were found between biomass and read numbers, abundance estimates significantly skewed the communities' composition in these two techniques. NGS barcoding recovered the same ecological patterns as morphology. Ecological conclusions based on metabarcoding and mitogenomics were similar to those based on morphology when using presence/absence data, but different when using abundance data. In terms of workload and cost, we show that metabarcoding and NGS barcoding can compete with morphology, but not mitogenomics which was consistently more expensive. Based on these results, we advocate that NGS barcoding is currently the seemliest NGS method for monitoring of wild bees. Furthermore, this method has the advantage of potentially linking DNA sequences with preserved voucher specimens, which enable morphological re-examination and will thus produce verifiable records which can be fed into faunistic databases.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","conservation biology | DNA barcoding | insects | molecular identification | pollinators | survey","11700154306","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","175",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

They contribute to ecosystem functioning through roles as mutualists and pathogens for larger species, and as key components of food webs and nutrient cycles. Bacterial communities respond to environmental disturbances, and the tracking of these communities across space and time may serve as indicators of ecosystem health in areas of conservation concern. Recent advances in DNA sequencing of environmental samples allow for rapid and culture-free characterization of bacterial communities. Here we conduct the first metabarcoding survey of bacterial diversity in the waterholes of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. We show that eDNA can be amplified from waterholes and find strongly structured microbial communities, likely reflecting local abiotic conditions, animal ecology, and anthropogenic disturbance. Over timescales from days to weeks we find increased turnover in community composition, indicating bacteria may represent host-associated taxa of large vertebrates visiting the waterholes. Through taxonomic annotation we also identify pathogenic taxa, demonstrating the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for surveillance of infectious diseases.

Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) is one of the most devastating diseases of cereals worldwide, threatening both crop production by affecting cereal grain development, and human and animal health by contaminating grains with mycotoxins. Despite that maize residues constitute the primary source of inoculum for Fusarium pathogenic species, the structure and diversity of Fusarium spp. and microbial communities in maize residues have received much less attention than in grains. In this study, a metabarcoding approach was used to study the bacterial, fungal and Fusarium communities encountered in maize stalks collected from 8 fields in Brittany, France, after maize harvest during fall 2015. Some predominant genera found in maize residues were cereal or maize pathogens, such as the fungal Fusarium, Acremonium, and Phoma genera, and the bacterial Pseudomonas and Erwinia genera. Furthermore, a high predominance of genera with previously reported biocontrol activity was found, including the bacterial Sphingomonas, Pedobacter, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Janthinobacterium genera; and the fungal Epicoccum, Articulospora, Exophiala, and Sarocladium genera. Among Fusarium spp., F. graminearum and F. avenaceum were dominant. We also found that the maize cultivar and previous crop could influence the structure of microbial communities. Using SparCC co-occurrence network analysis, significant negative correlations were obtained between Fusarium spp. responsible for FHB (including F. graminearum and F. avenaceum) and bacterial OTUs classified as Sphingomonas and fungal OTUs classified as Sarocladium and Epicoccum. Considering that isolates belonging to these taxa have already been associated with antagonist effect against different Fusarium spp. and/or other pathogenic microorganisms and due to their predominance and negative associations with Fusarium spp., they may be good candidates as biocontrol agents. Combining the use of Fusarium-specific primers with universal primers for bacteria and fungi allowed us to study the microbial communities, but also to track correlations between Fusarium spp. and other bacterial and fungal genera, using co-occurrence network analysis.

Background: Effective biodiversity monitoring is fundamental in tracking changes in ecosystems as it relates to commercial, recreational, and conservation interests. Current approaches to survey coral reef ecosystems center on the use of indicator species and repeat surveying at specific sites. However, such approaches are often limited by the narrow snapshot of total marine biodiversity that they describe and are thus hindered in their ability to contribute to holistic ecosystem-based monitoring. In tandem, environmental DNA (eDNA) and next-generation sequencing metabarcoding methods provide a new opportunity to rapidly assess the presence of a broad spectrum of eukaryotic organisms within our oceans, ranging from microbes to macrofauna. Methods: We here investigate the potential for rapid universal metabarcoding surveys (RUMS) of eDNA in sediment samples to provide snapshots of eukaryotic subtropical biodiversity along a depth gradient at two coral reefs in Okinawa, Japan based on 18S rRNA. Results: Using 18S rRNA metabarcoding, we found that there were significant separations in eukaryotic community assemblages (at the family level) detected in sediments when compared across different depths ranging from 10 to 40 m (p = 0.001). Significant depth zonation was observed across operational taxonomic units assigned to the class Demospongiae (sponges), the most diverse class (contributing 81% of species) within the phylum Porifera; the oldest metazoan phylum on the planet. However, zonation was not observed across the class Anthozoa (i.e., anemones, stony corals, soft corals, and octocorals), suggesting that the former may serve as a better source of indicator species based on sampling over fine spatial scales and using this universal assay. Furthermore, despite their abundance on the examined coral reefs, we did not detect any octocoral DNA, which may be due to low cellular shedding rates, assay sensitivities, or primer biases. Discussion: Overall, our pilot study demonstrates the importance of exploring depth effects in eDNA and suggest that RUMS may be applied to provide a baseline of information on eukaryotic marine taxa at coastal sites of economic and conservation importance.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","18S rRNA | Anthozoa | Community structure | Demospongiae | Environmental DNA | Eukaryote | Porifera | Sponge loop","21100239256","LP160100839","Australian Research Council","1","TRUE","178","2019","2",NA,"e6379",NA,NA,2019

The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) methods for community analysis has recently been developed. High-throughput parallel DNA sequencing (HTS), called eDNA metabarcoding, has been increasingly used in eDNA studies to examine multiple species. However, eDNA metabarcoding methodology requires validation based on traditional methods in all natural ecosystems before a reliable method can be established. To date, relatively few studies have performed eDNA metabarcoding of fishes in aquatic environments where fish communities were intensively surveyed using multiple traditional methods. Here, we have compared fish communities' data from eDNA metabarcoding with seven conventional multiple capture methods in 31 backwater lakes in Hokkaido, Japan. We found that capture and field surveys of fishes were often interrupted by macrophytes and muddy sediments in the 31 lakes. We sampled 1 L of the surface water and analyzed eDNA using HTS. We also surveyed the fish communities using seven different capture methods, including various types of nets and electrofishing. At some sites, we could not detect any eDNA, presumably because of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibition. We also detected the marine fish species as sewage-derived eDNA. Comparisons of eDNA metabarcoding and capture methods showed that the detected fish communities were similar between the two methods, with an overlap of 70%. Thus, our study suggests that to detect fish communities in backwater lakes, the performance of eDNA metabarcoding with the use of 1 L surface water sampling is similar to that of capturing methods. Therefore, eDNA metabarcoding can be used for fish community analysis but environmental factors that can cause PCR inhibition, should be considered in eDNA applications.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"10600153309","JPMJCR13A2","Japan Science and Technology Agency","1","TRUE","181","14","1","30703107","e0210357","JST",NA,2019

To obtain an accurate estimate of a consumer's diet should we work strictly with data sets summarizing frequency of occurrence of different food taxa, or is it possible to use relative number of sequences? Both approaches are applied to obtain semi-quantitative diet summaries, but occurrence data are often promoted as a more conservative and reliable option due to taxa-specific biases in recovery of sequences. We explore representative dietary metabarcoding data sets and point out that diet summaries based on occurrence data often overestimate the importance of food consumed in small quantities (potentially including low-level contaminants) and are sensitive to the count threshold used to define an occurrence. Our simulations indicate that using relative read abundance (RRA) information often provides a more accurate view of population-level diet even with moderate recovery biases incorporated; however, RRA summaries are sensitive to recovery biases impacting common diet taxa.

The research of prey preferences of different predators requires knowledge not only of the prey consumed, but also of what is available. In this study, we applied DNA metabarcoding to analyze the diet of 4 bird species (willow tits Poecile montanus, Siberian tits Poecile cinctus, great tits Parus major and blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus) by using the feces of nestlings. The availability of their assumed prey (Lepidoptera) was determined from feces of larvae (frass) collected from the main foraging habitat, birch (Betula spp.) canopy. We identified 53 prey species from the nestling feces, of which 11 (21%) were also detected from the frass samples (eight lepidopterans). Approximately 80% of identified prey species in the nestling feces represented lepidopterans, which is in line with the earlier studies on the parids' diet. A subsequent laboratory experiment showed a threshold for fecal sample size and the barcoding success, suggesting that the smallest frass samples do not contain enough larval DNA to be detected by high-throughput sequencing. To summarize, we apply metabarcoding for the first time in a combined approach to identify available prey (through frass) and consumed prey (via nestling feces), expanding the scope and precision for future dietary studies on insectivorous birds.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","dietary ecology | DNA barcoding | fecal DNA | frass | insectivorous birds | Lepidoptera | metagenomics","21100264002","283609","Academy of Finland","1","TRUE","183","9","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Surprisingly, 1,228 (4.8%) mites from 84 (7.4%) birds were found on host species that were not the expected to be a host according to a recent bird–feather mite associations catalog. Unexpected associations were widespread across studied mite (40.6%) and bird (43.7%) species and showed smaller average infrapopulation sizes than typical associations. Unexpected mite species colonized hosts being distantly related to the set of their usual hosts, but with similar body size. The network of bird–mite associations was modular (i.e., some groups of bird and mite species tended to be more associated with each other than with the others), with 75.9% of the unexpected associations appearing within the module of the typical hosts of the mite species. Lastly, 68.4% of mite species found on unexpected hosts showed signatures of genetic differentiation, and we found evidence for reproduction or the potential for it in many of the unexpected associations. Results show host colonization as a common phenomenon even for these putatively highly host-specific symbionts. Thus, host-switching by feather mites, rather than a rare phenomenon, appears as a relatively frequent phenomenon shaped by ecological filters such as host morphology and is revealed as a fundamental component for a dynamic coevolutionary and codiversification scenario.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Acariformes | Analgoidea | Aves | coevolution | diversification | horizontal transmission | Sarcoptiformes","20297","SVP-2013– 067,939","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad","0","FALSE","184","28","2","30536745",NA,NA,NA,2019

Emerging DNA metabarcoding techniques could potentially revolutionise monitoring of invertebrates by providing the ability to characterise entire communities from a single, easily collected environmental sample. We aimed to characterise the invertebrate fauna of an isolated, coastal forest fragment in New Zealand using the same level of financial investment for conventional invertebrate monitoring (pitfall and malaise traps) and a DNA metabarcoding approach applied to two alternative sample types (conventional invertebrate samples and soil samples). The bulk invertebrate and soil DNA metabarcoding methods were able to reproduce ecological patterns observed in the beetle community detected using conventional sampling. The soil DNA metabarcoding method detected a different beetle community and a more diverse array of invertebrate taxa than conventional sampling techniques. DNA metabarcoding offers conservation managers a practical, cost-effective technique for characterising whole invertebrate communities.

Molecular Ecology Resources Published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Insect metabarcoding has been mainly based on PCR amplification of short fragments within the “barcoding region” of the gene cytochrome oxidase I (COI). However, because of the variability of this gene, it has been difficult to design good universal PCR primers. Most primers used today are associated with gaps in the taxonomic coverage or amplification biases that make the results less reliable and impede the detection of species that are present in the sample. We identify new primers for insect metabarcoding using computational approaches (ecoprimers and degeprime) applied to the most comprehensive reference databases of mitochondrial genomes of Hexapoda assembled to date. New primers are evaluated in silico against previously published primers in terms of taxonomic coverage and resolution of the corresponding amplicons. For the latter criterion, we propose a new index, exclusive taxonomic resolution, which is a more biologically meaningful measure than the standard index used today. Our results show that the best markers are found in the ribosomal RNA genes (12S and 16S); they resolve about 90% of the genetically distinct species in the reference database. Some markers in protein-coding genes provide similar performance but only at much higher levels of primer degeneracy. Combining two of the best individual markers improves the effective taxonomic resolution with up to 10%. The resolution is strongly dependent on insect taxon: COI primers detect 40% of Hymenoptera, while 12S primers detect 12% of Collembola.

Here, we provide the rationale to understand under what circumstances the technique can be quantitative. In essence, we simulate a mixture of DNA of S species with a defined initial abundance distribution. In the simulated PCR, each species increases its concentration following a certain amplification efficiency. The final DNA concentration will reflect the initial one when the efficiency is similar for all species; otherwise, the initial and final DNA concentrations would be poorly related. Although there are many known factors that modulate amplification efficiency, we focused on the number of primer–template mismatches, arguably the most important one. We used 15 common primers pairs targeting the mitochondrial COI region and the mitogenomes of ca. 1,200 insect species. The results showed that some primers pairs produced quantitative results under most circumstances, whereas some other primers failed to do so.

Methods in Ecology and Evolution © 2019 British Ecological Society Food webs form the basis of biological communities, though empirical research has been hindered by difficulties in quantifying interactions. Metabarcoding from predator gut content extractions with universal primers promises to provide simple and rapid insights into food web interactions. However, the highly overabundant predator DNA often completely out-competes that of the digested prey DNA during PCR, impeding the ability to assess the abundance and diversity of prey items. Focusing on the issue of overabundance of predator DNA amplified by a commonly used COI primer pair, we use predator lineage-specific SNPs at the 3’-end of PCR primers to selectively block out predators from amplification. While this approach largely prevents predator amplification, it retains high taxonomic versatility for prey lineages. We introduce a novel multilocus assay, targeting four nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA markers, and test our approach in a diverse set of spiders from 12 families. We estimate the recovered prey DNA proportions and compare the taxonomic composition of prey communities between markers. Using a feeding experiment, we also explore recovery of prey DNA over time. While commonly used COI primers yield low and very unpredictable amounts of prey DNA, our assay allows for a considerable and consistent prey enrichment across all tested species. The recovered prey's taxonomic composition is comparable between markers and supports results acquired by COI. The new marker set can be amplified in a simple multiplex PCR, considerably reducing the necessary workload. Our multilocus approach allows the generation of an unprecedented amount of prey data at low cost and effort. Lineage-specific PCR is taxonomically versatile and could readily be adapted to any prey–predator interaction, opening up the opportunity for community-wide studies on food web interactions.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","lineage specific PCR | metabarcoding | predation | prey detection | prey-predator interaction | ribosomal DNA","21100217611","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","192",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Fungi play an important role in cycling organic matter and nutrients in marine ecosystems. However, the distribution of fungal communities in the ocean, especially the vertical distribution along depth in the water column, remained poorly understood. Here, we assess the depth-related distribution pattern of fungal communities along the water column from epi- to abyssopelagic zones of the Western Pacific Ocean using internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) metabarcoding. Majority of the assigned OTUs were affiliated to Ascomycota, followed by three other minor phyla (Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Mucoromycota). The epipelagic zone harbored a higher OTU richness with distinct fungal communities as compared with meso-, bathy-, and abyssopelagic zones. Across the whole water column, depth appears as a key parameter for both fungal a- and ß-diversity. However, when the dataset was split into the upper (5–500 m) and deeper (below 500 m) layers, no significant correlation was observed between depth and community compositions. In the upper layer, temperature and dissolved oxygen were recognized as the primary environmental factors shaping fungal a- and ß- diversity. By parsing fungal OTUs into ecological categories, multi-trophic mode of nutrition was found to be more prevalent with increasing depth, suggesting a potential adaptation to the extreme conditions of the deep sea.

Copper (Cu) pollution in coastal areas is a worldwide threat for aquatic communities. This study aims to demonstrate the usefulness of the DNA metabarcoding analysis in order to describe the ecotoxicological effect of Cu at environmental concentrations on marine periphyton. Additionally, the study investigates if Cu-induced changes in community structure co-occurs with changes in community functioning (i.e., photosynthesis and community tolerance to Cu). Periphyton was exposed for 18 days to five Cu concentrations, between 0.01 and 10 µM, in a semi-static test. Diversity and community structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms were assessed by 16S and 18S amplicon sequencing, respectively. Community function was studied as impacts on algal biomass and photosynthetic activity. Additionally, we studied Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) using photosynthesis as the endpoint. Sequencing results detected an average of 9,504 and 1,242 OTUs for 16S and 18S, respectively, reflecting the high biodiversity of marine periphytic biofilms. Eukaryotes represent the most Cu-sensitive kingdom, where effects were seen already at concentrations as low as 0.01 µM. The structure of the prokaryotic part of the community was impacted at slightly higher concentrations (0.06 µM), which is still in the range of the Cu concentrations observed in the area (0.08 µM). The current environmental quality standard for Cu of 0.07 µM therefore does not seem to be sufficiently protective for periphyton. Cu exposure resulted in a more Cu-tolerant community, which was accompanied by a reduced total algal biomass, increased relative abundance of diatoms and a reduction of photosynthetic activity. Cu exposure changed the network of associations between taxa in the communities. A total of 23 taxa, including taxa within Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Stramenopiles, and Hacrobia, were identified as being particularly sensitive to Cu. DNA metabarcoding is presented as a sensitive tool for community-level ecotoxicological studies that allows to observe impacts simultaneously on a multitude of pro- and eukaryotic taxa, and therefore to identify particularly sensitive, non-cultivable taxa.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","16S | 18S | Amplicon-sequencing | Metabarcoding | Metals | Periphyton","21100226442","2011-1733","National Institute for Health and Care Excellence","1","TRUE","194","10","JAN",NA,"3248",NA,NA,2019

For most reef-building corals, the establishment of symbiosis occurs via horizontal transmission, where juvenile coral recruits acquire their algal symbionts (family Symbiodiniaceae) from their surrounding environment post-settlement. This transmission strategy allows corals to interact with a diverse array of symbionts, potentially facilitating adaptation to the newly settled environment. We exposed aposymbiotic Pseudodiploria strigosa recruits from the Flower Garden Banks to natal reef sediment (C-S+), symbiotic adult coral fragments (C+S-), sediment and coral fragments (C+S+), or seawater controls (C-S-) and quantified rates of symbiont uptake and Symbiodiniaceae community composition within each recruit using metabarcoding of the ITS2 locus. The most rapid uptake was observed in C+S+ treatments, and this combination also led to the highest symbiont alpha diversity in recruits. While C-S+ treatments exhibited the next highest uptake rate, only one individual recruit successfully established symbiosis in the C+S- treatment, suggesting that sediment both serves as a direct symbiont source for coral recruits and promotes (or, potentially, mediates) transmission from adult coral colonies. In turn, presence of adult corals facilitated uptake from the sediment, perhaps via chemical signaling. Taken together, our results reinforce the key role of sediment in algal symbiont uptake by P. strigosa recruits and suggest that sediment plays a necessary, but perhaps not sufficient, role in the life cycle of algal Symbiodiniaceae symbionts.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Coral | Horizontal transmission | ITS2 | Metabarcoding | Sediment | Symbiodiniaceae | Symbiosis","26825","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","195",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Accelerated low water corrosion (ALWC) is a form of microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) associated with the degradation of marine structures around the low tide water level. A better understanding of the role of microbes in this degradation and the source of these microbes is required to improve the prediction and mitigation of the costly failures occurring due to ALWC. The microbial communities present in a sediment sample and on an ALWC tubercle on adjacent steel sheet piling from a tidal estuary were studied using culture-based isolation and metabarcoding. A total of 43 pure cultures were isolated from the sediment using a variety of culture conditions. Phylogenetic analysis of their 16S rRNA genes placed them in the Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria). 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding of the sediment and tubercle revealed similar microbial groups at varying relative abundances. No Deltaproteobacteria were isolated from the sediment but they were present in both samples according to metabarcoding and their high abundance (49.3%) in the tubercle could indicate an important functional role. Although some sediment isolates and operational taxonomic units from the metabarcoding have previously been associated with surface colonisation or biofilm formation in MIC, there was no strong evidence for the notion that the sediment adjacent to ALWC was the source of tubercle microbes. Further isolation strategies and functional investigations of representative bacteria at different stages of corrosion are being carried out for additional laboratory-based corrosion studies.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","Accelerated low water corrosion | Isolation | Metabarcoding | Microbiologically influenced corrosion | Sediment | Tubercle","14957","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","197","103","1","30349932",NA,NA,NA,2019

Here, we demonstrate three key methods for incorporating DNA data into network ecology and discuss analytical considerations using a model consisting of plants, insects, bats and their parasites from the Costa Rica dry forest. The simplest method involves the use of Sanger sequencing to acquire long sequences to validate or refine field identifications, for example of bats and their parasites, where one specimen yields one sequence and one identification. This method can be fully quantified and resolved and these data resemble traditional ecological networks. For more complex taxonomic identifications, we target multiple DNA loci, for example from a seed or fruit pulp sample in faeces. These networks are also well resolved but gene targets vary in resolution and quantification is difficult. Finally, for mixed templates such as faecal contents of insectivorous bats, we use DNA metabarcoding targeting two sequence lengths (157 and 407 bp) of one gene region and a MOTU, BLAST and BIN association approach to resolve nodes. This network type is complex to generate and analyse, and we discuss the implications of this type of resolution on network analysis. Using these data, we construct the first molecular-based network of networks containing 3,304 interactions between 762 nodes of eight trophic functions and involving parasitic, mutualistic and predatory interactions.

The conversion of natural habitats to agriculture is one of the main drivers of biotic change. Madagascar is no exception and land-use change, mostly driven by slash-and-burn agriculture, is impacting the island's exceptional biodiversity. Although most species are negatively affected by agricultural expansion, some, such as synanthropic bats, are capable of exploring newly available resources and benefit from man-made agricultural ecosystems. As bats are known predators of agricultural pests it seems possible that Malagasy bats may be preferentially foraging within agricultural areas and therefore provide important pest suppression services. To investigate the potential role of bats as pest suppressors, we conducted acoustic surveys of insectivorous bats in and around Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, during November and December 2015. We surveyed five landcover types: irrigated rice, hillside rice, secondary vegetation, forest fragment and continuous forest. 9569 bat passes from a regional assemblage of 19 species were recorded. In parallel, we collected faeces from the six most common bat species to detect insect pest species in their diet using DNA metabarcoding. Total bat activity was higher over rice fields when compared to forest and bats belonging to the open space and edge space sonotypes were the most benefited by the conversion of forest to hillside and irrigated rice. Two economically important rice pests were detected in the faecal samples collected - the paddy swarming armyworm Spodoptera mauritia was detected in Mops leucogaster samples while the grass webworm Herpetogramma licarsisalis was detected from Mormopterus jugularis and Miniopterus majori samples. Other crops pests detected included the sugarcane cicada Yanga guttulata, the macadamia nut-borer Thaumatotibia batrachopa and the sober tabby Ericeia inangulata (a pest of citrus fruits). Samples from all bat species also contained reads from important insect disease vectors. In light of our results we argue that Malagasy insectivorous bats have the potential to suppress agricultural pests. It is important to retain and maximise Malagasy bat populations as they may contribute to higher agricultural yields and promote sustainable livelihoods.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Acoustics | Agriculture | Chiroptera | Crop pests | Ecosystem services | Metabarcoding | Pest control | Rice","15110","257686","Academy of Finland","0","FALSE","199","269",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0167880918303761",2019

Developing an efficient and nondestructive method to assess biodiversity in tropical freshwaters is highly important. In this study, we tested the efficiency of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to assess the fish diversity of 39 Guianese sites. We compared the diversity and composition of assemblages obtained using traditional and metabarcoding methods. More than 7,000 individual fish belonging to 203 Guianese fish species were collected by traditional sampling methods, and ~17 million reads were produced by metabarcoding, among which ~8 million reads were assigned to 148 fish taxonomic units, including 132 fish species. The two methods detected a similar number of species at each site, but the species identities partially matched. The assemblage compositions from the different drainage basins were better discriminated using metabarcoding, revealing that while traditional methods provide a more complete but spatially limited inventory of fish assemblages, metabarcoding provides a more partial but spatially extensive inventory. eDNA metabarcoding can therefore be used for rapid and large-scale biodiversity assessments, while at a local scale, the two approaches are complementary and enable an understanding of realistic fish biodiversity.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","environmental DNA | fish assemblage | metabarcoding | reference database | tropical","11700154306","ANR-10-LABX-25-01","Agence Nationale de la Recherche","1","TRUE","200","19","1","29768738",NA,NA,NA,2019

Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major cereal disease caused by a complex of Fusarium species. These species vary in importance depending on climatic conditions, agronomic factors or host genotype. In addition, Fusarium species can release toxic secondary metabolites. These mycotoxins constitute a significant food safety concern as they have health implications in both humans and animals. The Fusarium species involved in FHB differ in their pathogenicity, ability to produce mycotoxins, and fungicide sensitivity. Accurate and exhaustive identification of Fusarium species in planta is therefore of great importance. In this study, using a new set of primers targeting the EF1a gene, the diversity of Fusarium species on cereals was evaluated using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The PCR amplification parameters and bioinformatic pipeline were optimized with mock and artificially infected grain communities and further tested on 65 field samples. Fusarium species were retrieved from mock communities and good reproducibility between different runs or PCR cycle numbers was be observed. The method enabled the detection of as few as one single Fusarium-infected grain in 10,000. Up to 17 different Fusarium species were detected in field samples of barley, durum and soft wheat harvested in France. This new set of primers enables the assessment of Fusarium diversity by high-throughput sequencing on cereal samples. It provides a more exhaustive picture of the Fusarium community than the currently used techniques based on isolation or species-specific PCR detection. This new experimental approach may be used to show changes in the composition of the Fusarium complex or to detect the emergence of new Fusarium species as far as the EF1a sequence of these species show a sufficient amount of polymorphism in the portion of sequence analyzed. Information on the distribution and prevalence of the different Fusarium species in a given geographical area, and in response to various environmental factors, is of great interest for managing the disease and predicting mycotoxin contamination risks.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","9",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","205","14","1","30633747","e0207988",NA,NA,2019

Journal of Applied Ecology © 2019 British Ecological Society Invertebrate-derived DNA (iDNA), in combination with high throughput sequencing, has been proposed as a cost-efficient and powerful tool to survey vertebrate species. Previous studies, however, have only provided evidence that vertebrates can be detected using iDNA, but have not taken the next step of placing these detection events within a statistical framework that allows for robust biodiversity assessments. Here, we compare concurrent iDNA and camera-trap surveys. Leeches were repeatedly collected in close vicinity to 64 camera-trap stations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We analyse iDNA-derived mammalian detection events in a modern occupancy model that accounts for imperfect detection and compare the results with those from occupancy models parameterised with camera-trap-derived detection events. We also combine leech-iDNA and camera-trap data in a single occupancy model. We found consistent estimates of occupancy probabilities produced by our camera-trap and leech datasets. This indicates that the metabarcoding of leech-iDNA method provides reasonable estimates of occupancy and may be a suitable method for studying and monitoring mammal species in tropical rainforests. However, we also show that a more extensive collection of leeches would be needed to assess mammal biodiversity with a robustness similar to that of camera traps. As certain taxa were only detected in leeches, we see great potential in complementing camera-trap studies with the iDNA approach, as long as the collection of leeches follows a robust and standardised sampling scheme. Synthesis and applications. Here, we describe an approach to analyse detection records of mammals derived from leech samples using an occupancy framework that accounts for leech-specific factors influencing the detection probability. We further combined camera trap and leech data, which lead to increased confidence in occupancy estimates. Our approach is not restricted to the processing of leech samples, but can be used for the analysis of other invertebrate DNA and environmental DNA data. Our study is the first step to shift the application of invertebrate DNA studies from opportunistic ad-hoc collections to the systematic surveys required for long-term management of wildlife populations.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","biodiversity | Borneo | conservation | environmental DNA | invertebrate DNA | leeches | mammals | Southeast Asia","29547","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","206",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Decomposition is a major flux of the carbon cycle in forest soils and understanding the involved processes is a key for budgeting carbon turnover. Decomposition is constrained by the presence of biological agents such as microorganisms and the underlying environmental conditions such as water availability. A metabarcoding approach of ribosomal markers was chosen to study the succession of bacterial and fungal decomposers on root litter. Litterbags containing pine roots were buried in a pine forest for two years and sequentially sampled. Decomposition and the associated communities were surveyed under ambient dry and long-term irrigation conditions. Early decomposition stages were characterized by the presence of fast-cycling microorganisms such as Bacteroidetes and Helotiales, which were then replaced by more specialized bacteria and litter-associated or parasitic groups such as Acidobacteria, white rots, and Pleosporales. This succession was likely driven by a decrease of easily degradable carbohydrates and a relative increase in persistent compounds such as lignin. We hypothesize that functional redundancy among the resident microbial taxa caused similar root decomposition rates in control and irrigated forest soils. These findings have important implications for drought-prone Alpine forests as frequent drought events reduce litter fall, but not litter decomposition, potentially resulting in lower carbon stocks.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"5800173382","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","207",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

However, little is currently known about how these environmental drivers may affect edaphic organisms within these ecosystems. In this study, we examined communities of plant root-associated fungi (RAF) over large biogeographical scales and along climatic gradients in the North Atlantic region in order to gain insights into the potential effects of climate variability on these communities. We also investigated whether selected fungal traits were associated with particular climates. Locations: Austria, Scotland, Mainland Norway, Iceland, Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Taxa: Root fungi associated with the ectomycorrhizal and herbaceous plant Bistorta vivipara. Methods: DNA metabarcoding of the ITS1 region was used to characterize the RAF of 302 whole plant root systems, which were analysed by means of ordination methods and linear modelling. Fungal spore length, width, volume and shape, as well as mycelial exploration type (ET) of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) basidiomycetes were summarized at a community level. Results: The RAF communities exhibited strong biogeographical structuring, and both compositional variation as well as fungal species richness correlated with annual temperature and precipitation. In accordance with general island biogeography theory, the least species-rich RAF communities were found on Jan Mayen, a remote and small island in the North Atlantic Ocean. Fungal spores tended to be more elongated with increasing latitude. We also observed a climate effect on which mycelial ET was dominating among the ectomycorrhizal fungi. Main conclusions: Both geographical and environmental variables were important for shaping root-associated fungal communities at a North Atlantic scale, including the High Arctic. Fungal OTU richness followed general biogeographical patterns and decreased with decreasing size and/or increasing isolation of the host plant population. The probability of possessing more elongated spores increases with latitude, which may be explained by a selection for greater dispersal capacity among more isolated host plant populations in the Arctic.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","12","Bistorta vivipara | climate variability | dispersal | mycorrhiza | North Europe | root-associated fungi","29269","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","208",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Methods: Samples of air, rock, sediment and water were collected from eight caves in Southwest China.

The effect of inoculation with activated sludge of a nearby domestic waste water treatment plant was investigated, which is a cheap procedure and easy to apply in practice. The study was performed at a three-stage and a two-stage full-scale biotrickling filter; of which, only the latter was inoculated. Both biotrickling filters evolved towards a rather similar community over time, which differed from the one in the activated sludge used for inoculation. However, the bacterial population at both biotrickling filters showed small differences on the family level. A large population of heterotrophic bacteria, including denitrifying bacteria, was present in both biotrickling filters. In the non-inoculated biotrickling filter, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) could not be detected, which corresponded with the incomplete nitrification leading to high nitrite accumulation observed in this system. Inoculation with the wide spectrum inoculum activated sludge had in this study a positive effect on the biotrickling filter performance (higher ammonia removal and lower nitrous oxide production). It could thus be beneficial to inoculate biotrickling filters in order to enrich NOB at the start-up, making it easier to keep the free nitrous acid concentration low enough to not be inhibited by it.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"19700175206","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","211",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

All Rights Reserved. Ciliates represent central nodes in freshwater planktonic food webs, and many species show pronounced seasonality, with short-lived maxima of a few dominant taxa while many being rare or ephemeral. These observations are primarily based on morphospecies counting methods, which, however, have limitations concerning the amount and volume of samples that can be processed. For high sampling frequencies at large scales, high throughput sequencing (HTS) of freshwater ciliates seems to be a promising tool. However, several studies reported large discrepancy between species abundance determinations by molecular compared to morphological means. Therefore, we compared ciliate DNA metabarcodes (V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene) with morphospecies counts for a 3-year study (Lake Zurich, Switzerland; biweekly sampling, n = 74). In addition, we isolated, cultivated and sequenced the 18S rRNA gene of twelve selected ciliate species that served as seeds for HTS analyses. This workflow allowed for a detailed comparison of V9 data with microscopic analyses by quantitative protargol staining (QPS). The dynamics of V9 read abundances over the seasonal cycle corroborated well with morphospecies population patterns. Annual successions of rare and ephemeral species were more adequately characterized by V9 reads than by QPS. However, numbers of species specific sequence reads only partly reflected rank orders seen by counts. In contrast, biomass-based assemblage compositions showed higher similarity to V9 read numbers, probably indicating a relation between cell sizes and numbers / sizes of macronuclei (or 18S rRNA operons). Full-length 18S rRNA sequences of ciliates assigned to certain morphospecies are urgently needed for barcoding approaches as planktonic taxa are still poorly represented in public databases and the interpretation of HTS data depends on profound reference sequences. Through linking operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with known morphospecies, we can use the deep knowledge about the autecology of these species.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Freshwater ciliates | Lake Zurich | Morphospecies counts | Planktonic ciliates | Seasonality | V9 region of the SSU rRNA gene","21100226442","I2238-B25","Austrian Science Fund","1","TRUE","212","10","FEB",NA,"248",NA,NA,2019

We evaluated the ability of these markers, singly and in combination, to delimit species by calculating intra- and interspecific genetic distances. We further estimated a plant community phylogeny and demonstrated its utility by testing if evolutionary relatedness could predict the tendency of members of the Mpala plant community to have or lack “barcode gaps”, defined as disparities between the maximum intra- and minimum interspecific genetic distances. We found barcode gaps for 72%–89% of taxa depending on the marker or markers used.

Seal-associated bacterial communities differed profoundly between the two colonies, despite the host populations themselves being genetically undifferentiated. Consistent with the hypothesis that social stress depresses bacterial diversity, we found that microbial alpha diversity was significantly lower in the high-density colony. Seals from one of the colonies that contained a stream also carried a subset of freshwater-associated bacteria, indicative of an influence of the physical environment. Furthermore, mothers and their offspring shared similar microbial communities, in support of the notion that microbes may facilitate mother–offspring recognition. Finally, a significant negative association was found between bacterial diversity and heterozygosity, a measure of host genetic quality. Our study thus reveals a complex interplay between environmental and host genetic effects, while also providing empirical support for the leash model of host control, which posits that bacterial communities are driven not only by bottom-up species interactions, but also by top-down host regulation.

Such plant–soil feedbacks in turn depend on the degree to which spatial distance and phylogenetic relatedness of host trees structure pathogen and mutualist communities, but research detailing these aspects of RAF communities is lacking. Here, we characterize plant–RAF associations across a diverse plant community, focusing on the degree to which RAF communities are structured by spatial distance, host phylogenetic relatedness, and host abundance. We compare results for different functional groups, including both putative mutualists and pathogens, an aspect poorly examined hitherto. We collected roots at regular intervals along ten 50 m by 2 m transects, then used DNA barcoding to identify host plants, and characterize the associated fungal community. Variance partitioning was used to measure the relative contributions of host phylogenetic relatedness and spatial distance to explaining RAF community composition. A weighted linear regression was used to measure the correlation between host abundance and RAF diversity. Phylogenetic distance among hosts was a better predictor of RAF community composition than spatial distance, but this relationship was stronger for putative pathogens than for mutualists, suggesting that pathogens show stronger host preference than mutualists. Across all functional groups, RAF showed similar levels of spatial structure. Additionally, RAF communities of locally abundant plants were less diverse than RAF communities of rare plants. Synthesis. We found that RAF communities are structured by the phylogenetic relatedness of hosts and, to a lesser extent, by spatial distance, with pathogens showing stronger host preference than mutualists. Abundant hosts had less diverse RAF communities than rare hosts, which is notable because abundant plants tend to experience weaker negative plant–soil feedback. Going forward, mechanisms underlying the host abundance-RAF diversity relationship warrant further investigation. Additionally, the survey approach presented here could be paired with experiments linking RAF community composition to plant recruitment.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","diversity maintenance | DNA metabarcoding | microbiome | plant–soil (below-ground) interactions | root-associated fungi | tropical rainforest","29602","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","218",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

The phylum Cyanobacteria comprises a non-photosynthetic lineage. The diversity and distribution of non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria (NCY) across aquatic environments are currently unknown, including their ecology. Here, we report about composition and phylogenetic diversity of two clades of NCY in ten lakes of the European peri-Alpine region, over the past ~100 years. Using 16S rDNA sequences obtained from dated sediment cores, we found almost equal proportion of taxa assigned to Melainabacteria and the deepest-branching group Sericytochromatia (ML635J-21) (63 total detected taxa). The topology of our reconstructed phylogenies reflected evolutionary relationships expected from previous work, that is, a clear separation between the deepest branching Sericytochromatia, the Melainabacteria, and the photosynthetic cyanobacteria clades. While different lakes harbored distinct NCY communities, the diversity of NCY assemblages within and between lakes (alpha and beta diversity) did not significantly change over the last century. This is in contrast with what was previously reported for photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Unchanged community phylogenetic similarity over geographic distance indicated no dispersal limitation of NCY at the regional scale. Our results solicit studies linking in-lake environmental factors to the composition of these microorganisms' communities, whose assembly appeared not to have been influenced by large-scale anthropogenic environmental changes. This is the first attempt to study the diversity and distribution of NCY taxa across temperate lakes. It provides a first step towards understanding their distribution and ecological function in pelagic aquatic habitats, where these organisms seem to be prevalent.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","Anthropocene | distance-decay relationship | Melainabacteria | meta-community | metabarcoding | ML635J-21 | sedimentary DNA | Sericytochromatia","21100226442","IZERZ0 – 142165",NA,"1","TRUE","220","10","JAN",NA,"03344",NA,NA,2019

Describing dynamics of belowground organisms, such as fungi, can be challenging. Results of studies based on environmental DNA (eDNA) may be biased as the template does not discriminate between metabolically active cells and dead biomass. We analyzed ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) coextracted from 48 soil samples collected from a manipulated snow depth experiment in two distinct vegetation types in Svalbard, in the High Arctic. Our main goal was to compare if the rDNA and rRNA metabarcoding templates produced congruent results that would lead to consistent ecological interpretation. Data derived from both rDNA and rRNA clustered according to vegetation types. Different sets of environmental variables explained the community composition based on the metabarcoding template. rDNA and rRNA-derived community composition of symbiotrophs and saprotrophs, unlike pathotrophs, clustered together in a similar way as when the community composition was analyzed using all OTUs in the study. Mean OTU richness was higher for rRNA, especially in symbiotrophs. The metabarcoding template was more important than vegetation type in explaining differences in richness. The proportion of symbiotrophic, saprotrophic and functionally unassigned reads differed between rDNA and rRNA, but showed similar trends. There was no evidence for increased snow depth influence on fungal community composition or richness. Our findings suggest that template choice may be especially important for estimating biodiversity, such as richness and relative abundances, especially in Helotiales and Agaricales, but not for inferring community composition. Differences in study results originating from rDNA or rRNA may directly impact the ecological conclusions of one's study, which could potentially lead to false conclusions on the dynamics of microbial communities in a rapidly changing Arctic.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Arctic vegetation | Below-ground processes | Fungal functional group | Fungal trophic mode | Snow fences | Snow regime","21100226442","230970","Universitetet i Oslo","1","TRUE","221","10","JAN",NA,"3243",NA,NA,2019

Wood decomposition is a key component of carbon cycling. However, our understanding of decomposition is limited by the absence of information regarding wood separated from the forest floor, which represents approximately half of total woody debris. We hypothesized that turnover in microbial (bacterial and fungal) community structure from the ground to the canopy causes decreasing rates of decomposition. To test this hypothesis, we used standardized wood sticks and metabarcoding to provide the first replicated assessment of decomposition and decomposer microbial community structure along a vertical gradient within a tropical forest. Community composition and functional groups of fungi and bacteria covaried strongly from ground to canopy, and both microbial groups exhibited distinct community types at different levels within the forest. Mass loss from wood sticks was strongly associated with both microclimate conditions and microbial community composition. However, unlike the continuous turnover of microbial communities, wood decomposition exhibited a binary pattern such that differences in decomposition were driven by soil contact and associated with increased moisture content. These findings are contrary to dominant models of decomposition that primarily consider environmental effects at larger scales and thus take an important first step in challenging the contemporary, ground-based understanding of decomposition. Contrasting patterns in the relative abundance of bacterial and fungal saprotrophs observed in this study suggest that additional work is needed to delineate the roles of invertebrate, fungal, and bacterial decomposers in higher levels of the forest.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","bacteria | community assembly | dead wood | environmental conditions | fungi | microbiome | saproxylic communities","20343","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","224",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Despite the importance of endosymbiotic dinoflagellates in the ecology of giant clams, the diversity and distribution of Symbiodiniaceae in different tridacnine species remain relatively poorly studied. Using a DNA metabarcoding approach based on the nuclear ribosomal ITS2 marker, this study examined the patterns of Symbiodiniaceae diversity and composition in two giant clam species, Tridacna maxima (n = 32) and Tridacna noae (n = 41) found at Dongsha Atoll, the largest atoll in the northern South China Sea. Both species of giant clams hosted Symbiodiniaceae from genera Symbiodinium (formerly Clade A), Cladocopium (formerly Clade C) and Durusdinium (formerly Clade D). Tridacna maxima harboured Cladocopium preferentially, followed by Symbiodinium and Durusdinium, while T. noae hosted Durusdinium most abundantly, followed by Symbiodinium and Cladocopium. Endosymbiont diversity also varied between host species—T. maxima contained 11 species while T. noae had 13 species. Among the endosymbionts, Cladocopium goreaui (ITS2 type C1) was most common in both host species. Further analyses revealed that endosymbiont species richness was influenced primarily by depth, size, and, to some extent, geographic locality of giant clams. Endosymbiont community structure was significantly different between host species and this variation was primarily driven by depth. Even though both tridacnine species share similar habitats on coral reefs, the contrasting diversity and composition of Symbiodiniaceae present in each species may underlie the host’s adaptability to micro- and macro-environmental changes. These results not only provide a baseline of the various endosymbionts occurring in giant clams on an isolated reef ecosystem, they provide useful information for predicting impacts on these host species that could arise due to climate-related environmental stressors.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Community structure | Coral reef | High-throughput sequencing | ITS2 | Symbiodiniaceae | Tridacna","14301","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","225",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous soil pollutants. The discovery that plants can stimulate microbial degradation of PAHs has promoted research on rhizoremediation strategies. We combined DNA-SIP with metagenomics to assess the influence of plants on the identity and metabolic functions of active PAH-degrading bacteria in contaminated soil, using phenanthrene (PHE) as a model hydrocarbon. 13 C-PHE dissipation was 2.5-fold lower in ryegrass-planted conditions than in bare soil. Metabarcoding of 16S rDNA revealed significantly enriched OTUs in 13 C-SIP incubations compared to 12 C-controls, namely 130 OTUs from bare soil and 73 OTUs from planted soil. Active PHE-degraders were taxonomically diverse (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes), with Sphingomonas and Sphingobium dominating in bare and planted soil, respectively. Plant root exudates favored the development of PHE-degraders having specific functional traits at the genome level. Indeed, metagenomes of 13 C-enriched DNA fractions contained more genes involved in aromatic compound metabolism in bare soil, whereas carbohydrate catabolism genes were more abundant in planted soil. Functional gene annotation allowed reconstruction of complete pathways with several routes for PHE catabolism. Sphingomonadales were the major taxa performing the first steps of PHE degradation in both conditions, suggesting their critical role to initiate in situ PAH remediation. Active PHE-degraders act in a consortium, whereby complete PHE mineralization is achieved through the combined activity of taxonomically diverse co-occurring bacteria performing successive metabolic steps.

To simplify DNA barcoding and metabarcoding studies of Neotropical freshwater fish, we present a new pair of COI primers, which have yielded high quality barcodes across six teleost orders-Characiformes, Cichliformes, Cyprinodontiformes, Gymnotiformes, Siluriformes, and Synbranchiformes-native to South America. Following previous fish barcoding studies, we also tailed our primers with M13 forward and reverse primers to facilitate the DNA sequencing process.

We characterised the taxonomic diversity, and from this, inferred the functional diversity of microeukaryotes in Sphagnum mosses in tropical, subtropical and temperate climatic zones through an environmental DNA diversity metabarcoding survey of the V9 region of the gene coding for the RNA of the small subunit of the ribosomes (SSU rRNA). As microbial processes are strongly driven by temperatures, we hypothesised that saprotrophy would be highest in warm regions, whereas mixotrophy, an optimal strategy in oligotrophic environments, would peak under colder climates. Phylotype richness was higher in tropical and subtropical climatic zones than in the temperate region, mostly due to a higher diversity of animal parasites (i.e. Apicomplexa). Decomposers, and especially opportunistic yeasts and moulds, were more abundant under warmer climates, while mixotrophic organisms were more abundant under temperate climates.

African sponges, particularly freshwater sponges, are understudied relative to demosponges in most other geographical regions. Freshwater sponges (Spongillida) likely share a common ancestor; however, their evolutionary history, particularly during their radiation into endemic and allegedly cosmopolitan groups, is unclear. Freshwater sponges of at least 58 species of 17 genera and four families are described from Central and Eastern Africa, but the diversity is underestimated due to limited distinguishable morphological features. The discovery of additional cryptic species is very likely with the use of molecular techniques such as DNA barcoding. The Royal Museum of Central Africa (MRAC, Tervuren, Belgium) hosts one of the largest collections of (Central) African freshwater sponge type material. Type specimens in theory constitute ideal targets for molecular taxonomy; however, the success is frequently hampered by DNA degradation and deamination, which are a consequence of suboptimal preservation techniques. Therefore, we genotyped African demosponge holotype material of the MRAC with specific short primers suitable for degenerated tissue and compare the results with the current, morphology-based classification.

We explored the nature of T. cruzi infection in small rodents from New Orleans (LA, USA), an enzootic region of the parasite in North America. Methods: We characterized the full complement of discrete typing units (DTUs) in rodent hosts through next-generation metabarcoding, as conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing approaches only detect the dominant genotype in biological samples. We assayed DTU diversity in tissue samples from 6 T. cruzi PCR positive rodents. The intergenic region of the mini-exon gene was amplified and sequenced on a MiSeq platform. A total of 141 sequences were aligned using Muscle, and TCS networks were constructed to identify DTUs in the samples. Results: We detected distinct and varying assemblages of DTUs in the rodent hosts. Highly diverse DTU assemblages were detected, with 6–32 haplotypes recovered per individual, spanning multiple DTUs (TcI,TcII, TcIV, TcV and TcVI). Haplotypes varied in frequencies from 82% to less than 0.1%. DTU composition varied according to the tissue analyzed. Rural and urban rodents carried similarly diverse DTU assemblages, though urban rodent species tended to harbor more haplotypes than their sylvatic counterparts. Conclusion: Our results affirm that mammalian hosts can concurrently harbor a diverse complement of parasites, and indicate that there is greater diversity of T. cruzi DTUs present in North America than previously thought.

Primers were designed, and cross-species amplification success was tested on DNA extracted from a taxonomic range of spiny-, clawed-, slipper- and blind lobsters.

Conservation of island endemics is a high priority for reducing biodiversity loss, but fundamental studies on many species remain lacking due to the small population size and limited accessibility to island habitats. In this review, I explored conservation issues of endangered bird species in oceanic island habitat, which have been revealed by the latest molecular techniques with a combination of conventional field work. Recent genetic studies revealed low genetic diversity of endangered island endemics. Analyses of genetic structure have revealed the gene flow of endemic birds among islands according to their flying abilities. Seasonal inter-island movement of Columbiformes and some finches have been observed, which might be related to fluctuating food resource availability among island habitats. Dietary analyses based on DNA metabarcoding for Columba janthina nitens revealed frequent consumption of introduced plants by this bird. This review may provide a new perspective for conservation biology in oceanic island ecosystems. That is, (a) appropriate management of genetic diversity within and outside of habitat before serious population declines occur, (b) detection of meaningful evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) considering flying ability of birds among islands and management of total habitat range within each ESU and (c) introduced species eradication designed to not to cause a negative impact on endangered species that may depend on introduced species for their food.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","1","Food selection | Genetic structure | Inter-island movement | Introduced species | Molecular markers","14580","20248017","Kyoto University","1","TRUE","235","34","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,2019

The growing grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) population in the Baltic Sea has created conflicts with local fisheries, comparable to similar emerging problems worldwide. Adequate information on the foraging habits is a requirement for responsible management of the seal population. We investigated the applicability of available dietary assessment methods by comparing morphological analysis and DNA metabarcoding of gut contents (short-term diet; n = 129/125 seals, respectively), and tissue chemical markers i.e. fatty acid (FA) profiles of blubber and stable isotopes (SIs) of liver and muscle (mid- or long-term diet; n = 108 seals for the FA and SI markers). The methods provided complementary information. Short-term methods indicated prey species and revealed dietary differences between age groups and areas but for limited time period. In the central Baltic, herring was the main prey, while in the Gulf of Finland percid and cyprinid species together comprised the largest part of the diet. Perch was also an important prey in the western Baltic Proper. The DNA analysis provided firm identification of many prey species, which were neglected or identified only at species group level by morphological analysis. Liver SIs distinguished spatial foraging patterns and identified potentially migrated individuals, whereas blubber FAs distinguished individuals frequently utilizing certain types of prey. Tissue chemical markers of adult males suggested specialized feeding to certain areas and prey, which suggest that these individuals are especially prone to cause economic losses for fisheries. We recommend combined analyses of gut contents and tissue chemical markers as dietary monitoring methodology of aquatic top predators to support an optimal ecosystem-based management.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","13",NA,"10600153309","00150994","Suomen Kulttuurirahasto","1","TRUE","237","14","1","30601857","e0208694",NA,NA,2019

Dinitrogen (N 2 ) fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) are an important source of new nitrogen in oligotrophic environments and represent stable members of the microbiome in tropical corals, while information on corals from temperate oligotrophic regions is lacking. Therefore, this study provides new insights into the diversity and activity of diazotrophs associated with the temperate coral Oculina patagonica from the Mediterranean Sea by combining metabarcoding sequencing of amplicons of both the 16S rRNA and nifH genes and 15 N 2 stable isotope tracer analysis to assess diazotroph-derived nitrogen (DDN) assimilation by the coral. Results show that the diazotrophic community of O. patagonica is dominated by autotrophic bacteria (i.e. Cyanobacteria and Chlorobia). The majority of DDN was assimilated into the tissue and skeletal matrix, and DDN assimilation significantly increased in bleached corals. Thus, diazotrophs may constitute an additional nitrogen source for the coral host, when nutrient exchange with Symbiodinium is disrupted (e.g. bleaching) and external food supply is limited (e.g. oligotrophic summer season). Furthermore, we hypothesize that DDN can facilitate the fast proliferation of endolithic algae, which provide an alternative carbon source for bleached O. patagonica. Overall, O. patagonica could serve as a good model for investigating the importance of diazotrophs in coral recovery from bleaching.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"19683","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","239","21","1","30452101",NA,NA,NA,2019

This is particularly true for gelatinous zooplankton including the marine pelagic tunicate, Dolioletta gegenbauri. In this study, we applied an 18S rRNA amplicon metabarcoding approach to identify the diet of captive-fed and wild-caught D. gegenbauri on the midcontinental shelf of the South Atlantic Bight, USA.

Sequences derived from larger metazoans were frequently observed in wild-caught animals but not in captive-fed animals suggesting experimental bias associated with captive feeding.

Control is dependent on the use of anthelmintic drugs which, in the case of livestock parasites, is severely compromised by the widespread development of drug resistance. There are now concerns regarding the emergence of anthelmintic resistance in parasitic nematodes of humans in response to the selection pressure resulting from mass drug administration programs. Consequently, there is an urgent need for sensitive, scalable and accurate diagnostic tools to detect the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. Detecting and measuring the frequency of resistance-associated mutations in parasite populations has the potential to provide sensitive and quantitative assessment of resistance emergence from an early stage. Here, we describe the development and validation of deep amplicon sequencing as a powerful new approach to detect and quantify the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with benzimidazole resistance. We have used parasite communities in sheep to undertake a proof-of-concept study of this approach. Sheep provide an excellent host system, as there are multiple co-infecting trichostrongylid nematode species, each likely with a varying prevalence of benzimidazole resistance. We demonstrate that the approach provides an accurate measure of resistance allele frequencies, and can reliably detect resistance alleles down to a frequency of 0.1%, making it particularly valuable for screening mutations in the early stages of resistance. We illustrate the power of the technique by screening UK sheep flocks for benzimidazole resistance-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms at three different codons of the ß-tubulin gene in seven different parasite species from 164 populations (95 from ewes and 69 from lambs) in a single MiSeq sequencing run. This approach provides a powerful new tool to screen for the emergence of anthelmintic resistance mutations in parasitic nematode populations of both animals and humans.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Anthelmintics | Benzimidazoles | Drug resistance | Haemonchus | Metabarcoding | Nemabiome | Nematodes | ß-Tubulin","22379","2014R027R","Alberta Livestock and Meat Agency","0","FALSE","242","49","1","30471287",NA,NA,"S0020751918302819",2019

While high-throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and limited quantities of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. Based on finding viral contamination in foetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or another nonbiological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low-input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments and time.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Desmodus rotundus | microbial community | shotgun metagenomics | virome","11700154306","MC_UU_12014/12","Medical Research Council","1","TRUE","245","19","1","30240114",NA,NA,NA,2019

For this, we use an elevational gradient in the High Arctic, asking how the environment and species traits interact in shaping predator–prey interactions involving the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis. To characterize the community of potential prey available to this predator, we used pitfall trapping and vacuum sampling. To characterize the prey actually consumed, we applied molecular gut content analysis. Using joint species distribution models, we found elevation and vegetation mass to explain the most variance in the composition of the prey community locally available. However, such environmental variables had only a small effect on the prey community found in the spider's gut. These observations indicate that Pardosa exerts selective feeding on particular taxa irrespective of environmental constraints. By directly modelling the probability of predation based on gut content data, we found that neither trait matching in terms of predator and prey body size nor phylogenetic or environmental constraints modified interaction probability. Our results indicate that taxonomic identity may be more important for predator–prey interactions than environmental constraints or prey traits. The impact of environmental change on predator–prey interactions thus appears to be indirect and mediated by its imprint on the community of available prey.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","altitudinal gradient, body mass | interaction probability | lycosidae | metabarcoding | predator–prey interaction","20297","308651","Academy of Finland","0","FALSE","246","28","2","30230073",NA,NA,NA,2019

The Royle's pika (Ochotona roylei, hereafter pika) is a lagomorph found in the western Himalaya and is dependent on alpine plants that are at risk from climate change. As the main prey of many carnivores in the region, the pika plays a crucial role in trophic interactions. We examined topographical features, plant genera presence and seasonal dynamics as drivers of the plant richness in the pika's diet across an elevational gradient (2,600–4,450 m). We identified 79 plant genera in the faecal pellets of pikas, of which 89% were forbs, >60% were endemic to the Himalaya, and 97.5% of the diet plant genera identified followed the C 3 photosynthetic pathway. We found that, during the premonsoon season, the number of genera in the pika's diet decreased with increasing elevation. We demonstrate that a large area of talus supports greater plant diversity and, not surprisingly, results in higher species richness in the pika's diet. However, in talus habitat with deep crevices, pikas consumed fewer plant genera suggesting they may be foraging suboptimally due to predation risk.

Development is ongoing, with strong commercial interest, and new uses are continually being discovered. General applications of eDNA and guidelines for best practice in freshwater systems have been established, but habitat-specific assessments are lacking. Ponds are highly diverse, yet understudied systems that could benefit from eDNA monitoring. However, eDNA applications in ponds and methodological constraints specific to these environments remain unaddressed. Following a stakeholder workshop in 2017, researchers combined knowledge and expertise to review these applications and challenges that must be addressed for the future and consistency of eDNA monitoring in ponds. The greatest challenges for pond eDNA surveys are representative sampling, eDNA capture, and potential PCR inhibition. We provide recommendations for sampling, eDNA capture, inhibition testing, and laboratory practice, which should aid new and ongoing eDNA projects in ponds. If implemented, these recommendations will contribute towards an eventual broad standardisation of eDNA research and practice, with room to tailor workflows for optimal analysis and different applications.

This indirect effect may be particularly strong if predators shift diets between seasons. We therefore quantified the seasonal variation in diet of two wolf spider species that dominate the shoreline predator community, using molecular gut content analyses with general primers to detect the full prey range. Across the season, spider diets changed, with predominantly terrestrial prey from May until July and predominantly marine prey (mainly chironomids) from August until October. This pattern coincided with a change in the spider age and size structure, and prey abundance data and resource selection analyses suggest that the higher consumption of chironomids during autumn is due to an ontogenetic diet shift rather than to variation in prey abundance. The analyses suggested that small dipterans with a weak flight capacity, such as Chironomidae, Sphaeroceridae, Scatopsidae and Ephydridae, were overrepresented in the gut of small juvenile spiders during autumn, whereas larger, more robust prey, such as Lepidoptera, Anthomyidae and Dolichopodidae, were overrepresented in the diet of adult spiders during spring.

To begin to address this, we examined soil % C; % N; C:N ratio; soil microbial biomass C (C mic ); NO 3- ; NH 4+ ; pH; % moisture; % sand, silt, and clay; and elevation, along with soil bacterial and fungal community composition, and determined which soil abiotic properties structure the soil C mic and the soil bacterial and fungal communities across a primary forest, 33-year-old secondary forest, and 22-year-old young secondary in the Northern Zone of Costa Rica. We provide evidence that soil microbial communities were mostly distinct across the habitat types and that these habitats appear to have affected the soil ectomycorrhizal fungi and the soil microbial groups associated with the degradation of complex carbon compounds. We found that soil C mic levels increased along the management gradient from young, to old secondary, to primary forest. In addition, the changes in soil C mic and soil fungal community structure were significantly related to levels of soil NO 3- . Our analyses showed that even after 33 years of natural forest regrowth, the clearing of tropical forests can have persistent effects on soil microbial communities and that it may take a longer time than we realized for secondary forests to develop carbon-utilization efficiencies similar to that of a primary forest. Our results also indicated that forms of inorganic N may be an important factor in structuring soil C mic and the soil microbial communities, leading to improved CUE in regenerating secondary forests. This study is the first in the region to highlight some of the factors which appear to be structuring the soil C mic and soil microbial communities such that they are more conducive for enhanced CUE in secondary forests.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","16S rRNA | Costa Rica | DNA metabarcoding | DNA metasystematics | ITS rRNA | Secondary forests","20266","063-2008-SINAC","National Science Foundation","0","FALSE","250","77","1","29858646",NA,NA,NA,2019

Background: In previous studies, the gram-positive firmicute genus Paenibacillus was found with significant abundances in nests of wild solitary bees. Paenibacillus larvae is well-known for beekeepers as a severe pathogen causing the fatal honey bee disease American foulbrood, and other members of the genus are either secondary invaders of European foulbrood or considered a threat to honey bees. We thus investigated whether Paenibacillus is a common bacterium associated with various wild bees and hence poses a latent threat to honey bees visiting the same flowers. Results: We collected 202 samples from 82 individuals or nests of 13 bee species at the same location and screened each for Paenibacillus using high-throughput sequencing-based 16S metabarcoding. We then isolated the identified strain Paenibacillus MBD-MB06 from a solitary bee nest and sequenced its genome. We did find conserved toxin genes and such encoding for chitin-binding proteins, yet none specifically related to foulbrood virulence or chitinases. Phylogenomic analysis revealed a closer relationship to strains of root-associated Paenibacillus rather than strains causing foulbrood or other accompanying diseases. We found anti-microbial evidence within the genome, confirmed by experimental bioassays with strong growth inhibition of selected fungi as well as gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Conclusions: The isolated wild bee associate Paenibacillus MBD-MB06 is a common, but irregularly occurring part of wild bee microbiomes, present on adult body surfaces and guts and within nests especially in megachilids. It was phylogenetically and functionally distinct from harmful members causing honey bee colony diseases, although it shared few conserved proteins putatively toxic to insects that might indicate ancestral predisposition for the evolution of insect pathogens within the group. By contrast, our strain showed anti-microbial capabilities and the genome further indicates abilities for chitin-binding and biofilm-forming, suggesting it is likely a useful associate to avoid fungal penetration of the bee cuticula and a beneficial inhabitant of nests to repress fungal threats in humid and nutrient-rich environments of wild bee nests.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","16S metabarcoding | American foulbrood | Anti-microbial activity | Bacterial genomics | Bee disease | Bioassays | European foulbrood | Paenibacterin | Pathogen vector | Phylogenomics","21100401152","DFG KE1743/4-1","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","1","TRUE","251","6","1","30579360","229",NA,NA,2018

Conventional ecological risk assessment on toxic stressors in sediment is limited to a small and selected fraction of benthic communities. Ecogenomic approaches provide unprecedented capacity to monitor the changes of biodiversity and community composition in the field, but how to utilize it to assess ecological impact by contaminates remains largely unexplored. Here, an environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approach was used to assess the effect of copper on changes in biodiversity and community composition across the tree of life (including bacteria, protists, algae, fungi, and metazoa) in a field-based microcosm. Many microorganisms across a broad range of taxa groups changed their relative abundance in response to increased copper concentrations in sediments. Changes in community structure of microbiota appeared to be more sensitive to copper than survival of laboratory-bred organisms and indigenous macroinvertebrates. Copper caused a significant shift in prokaryotic community composition via substitution of dominant species. Network heterogeneity and Shannon diversity of the bacterial community decreased in the high copper treatments. eDNA metabarcoding assessed the effects of copper-contaminated sediment with less effort than manually processing samples.

Heartwood rot (a fungal disease) has the potential to significantly reduce the sandalwood oil production of Santalum album. With new plantations being established with sandalwood oil as the major product, it is imperative to know the consequences of routine form-pruning in tropical areas. Examining pruning wound responses in 1 and 5-year-old trees at the end of the dry and wet seasons, it was possible to ascertain the best pruning age and season in relation to occlusion. Pathogenic wood fungi were isolated from wounds and fungal spore monitoring was undertaken at the two trial sites at time of pruning. Younger trees had smaller wounds which were quicker to occlude and produced a lower decay rating which decreased over time. Wood inhabiting fungi were isolated from all pruning wounds and identified using the ITS gene region. There was a total of 531 fungal isolates, identified in 75 fungal taxa. Older trees had significantly more fungal species compared to younger trees. Pruning season did not significantly affect occlusion, the amount of resultant decay, nor the total number of fungal species isolated. Endophytes were isolated from every tree, comprising 52% of isolations. Younger trees had more endophytes, but less rot fungi than older trees. Canker fungi were isolated from almost all the older trees. In the older trees, rot fungi were predominant in trees pruned at end of the dry season. Metabarcoding of spores collected in spore traps resulted in 565 operational taxonomic units (OTU's) which were placed in 211 genera and 114 families, with about 55% classified as unknown fungi. About 23% of all reads corresponded to potential pathogens, however, the proportion of spore groups present at time of pruning at each plantation was not indicative of the fungal niches isolated from wounds. This study has shown that it is better to prune S. album when they are young to decrease the amount of potential decay. To reduce the risk of heartwood rot fungal diseases entering via the pruning wound, it would be preferable to prune at the beginning of the dry season. This will be applicable to other tropical tree species.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Decay | Occlusion | Pruning | Spores | Tropical forestry | Wound","25720","LP100200016","Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation","0","FALSE","253","430",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0378112718311563",2018

Background: DNA metabarcoding, commonly used in exploratory microbial ecology studies, is a promising method for the simultaneous in planta-detection of multiple pathogens associated with disease complexes, such as the grapevine trunk diseases. Profiling of pathogen communities associated with grapevine trunk diseases is particularly challenging, due to the presence within an individual wood lesion of multiple co-infecting trunk pathogens and other wood-colonizing fungi, which span a broad range of taxa in the fungal kingdom. As such, we designed metabarcoding primers, using as template the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer of grapevine trunk-associated ascomycete fungi (GTAA) and compared them to two universal primer widely used in microbial ecology. Results: We first performed in silico simulations and then tested the primers by high-throughput amplicon sequencing of (i) multiple combinations of mock communities, (ii) time-course experiments with controlled inoculations, and (iii) diseased field samples from vineyards under natural levels of infection. All analyses showed that GTAA had greater affinity and sensitivity, compared to those of the universal primers. Importantly, with GTAA, profiling of mock communities and comparisons with shotgun-sequencing metagenomics of field samples gave an accurate representation of genera of important trunk pathogens, namely Phaeomoniella, Phaeoacremonium, and Eutypa, the abundances of which were over- or under-estimated with universal primers. Conclusions: Overall, our findings not only demonstrate that DNA metabarcoding gives qualitatively and quantitatively accurate results when applied to grapevine trunk diseases, but also that primer customization and testing are crucial to ensure the validity of DNA metabarcoding results.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Amplicon sequencing | Botryosphaeria dieback | Esca | Eutypa dieback | Grapevine trunk diseases | High-throughput DNA sequencing | Metagenomics | Phomopsis dieback","19633","2012–51181-19954","U.S. Army Materiel Command","1","TRUE","254","18","1","30547761","214",NA,NA,2018

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a relatively new monitoring tool featuring in an increasing number of applications such as the facilitation of the accurate and cost effective detection of species in environmental samples. eDNA monitoring is likely to have a major impact on the ability of salmonid aquaculture industry producers and their regulators to detect the presence and abundance of pathogens and other biological threats in the surrounding environment. However, for eDNA metabarcoding to develop into a useful bio-monitoring tool it is necessary to (a) validate that sequence datasets derived from amplification of metabarcoding markers reflect the true species' identity, (b) test the sensitivity under different abundance levels and environmental noise and (c) establish a low-cost sequencing method to enable the bulk processing of field samples. In this study, we employed an elaborate experimental design whereby different combinations of five biological agents were crossed at three abundance levels and exposed to sterile pre-filtered and unfiltered seawater, prior to coarse filtering and then eDNA ultrafiltration of the resultant material. We then benchmarked the low-cost, scalable, Ion Torrent sequencing method against the current gold-standard Illumina platform for eDNA surveys in aquaculture. Based on amplicon-seq of the 18S SSU rDNA v9 region, we were able to identify two parasites (Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Paramoeba perurans) to species level, whereas the microalgae species Prymnesium parvum, Pseudo-nitzschia seriata, and P. delicatissima could be assigned correctly only to the genus level. Illumina and Ion Torrent provided near identical results in terms of community composition in our samples, whereas Ion Torrent was more sensitive in detecting species richness when the medium was unfiltered seawater. Both methods were able to reflect the difference in relative abundance between treatments in 4 out of 5 species when samples were exposed to the unfiltered seawater, despite the significant amount of background noise from both bacteria and eukaryotes. Our findings indicate that eDNA metabarcoding offers significant potential in the monitoring of species harmful to aquaculture and for this purpose, the low-cost Ion Torrent sequencing is as accurate as Illumina in determining differences in their relative abundance between samples.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Aquaculture | Environmental DNA (eDNA) | Lepeophtheirus salmonis | Paramoeba perurans | Prymnesium parvum | Pseudo-nitzschia seriata","21100226442","105614/Z/14/Z","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","1","TRUE","255","9","DEC",NA,"3009",NA,NA,2018

Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Metabarcoding combines DNA barcoding with high-throughput sequencing, often using one genetic marker to understand complex and taxonomically diverse samples. However, species-level identification depends heavily on the choice of marker and the selected primer pair, often with a trade-off between successful species amplification and taxonomic resolution. We present a versatile metabarcoding protocol for biomonitoring that involves the use of two barcode markers (COI and 18S) and four primer pairs in a single high-throughput sequencing run, via sample multiplexing. We validate the protocol using a series of 24 mock zooplanktonic communities incorporating various levels of genetic variation. With the use of a single marker and single primer pair, the highest species recovery was 77%. With all three COI fragments, we detected 62%–83% of species across the mock communities, while the use of the 18S fragment alone resulted in the detection of 73%–75% of species. The species detection level was significantly improved to 89%–93% when both markers were used. Furthermore, multiplexing did not have a negative impact on the proportion of reads assigned to each species and the total number of species detected was similar to when markers were sequenced alone. Overall, our metabarcoding approach utilizing two barcode markers and multiple primer pairs per barcode improved species detection rates over a single marker/primer pair by 14% to 35%, making it an attractive and relatively cost-effective method for biomonitoring natural zooplankton communities. We strongly recommend combining evolutionary independent markers and, when necessary, multiple primer pairs per marker to increase species detection (i.e., reduce false negatives) in metabarcoding studies.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","18S | cytochrome c oxidase subunit I | metabarcoding | multigene | multiple primer pairs | zooplankton","19400157205","MEC","Fisheries and Oceans Canada","1","TRUE","256","11","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

In response to the high demand for quick community descriptions, DNA metabarcoding can simultaneously assign taxonomy to hundreds of samples rapidly and at low cost. However, the technique has not routinely been incorporated into biomonitoring network programs yet. Here, we applied DNA metabarcoding methodologies at stations within the monitoring network of the Basque Water Agency, the competent authority for the application of the European Water Framework Directive in this region. We characterized the benthic macroinvertebrate communities from 18 estuarine and coastal sediment samples using morphology and metabarcoding-based taxonomic identification and evaluated the performance of several versions of the AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). Although metabarcoding detected 112 taxa against the 206 taxa identified through morphology, we showed that metabarcoding leads to similar biomonitoring conclusions compared with traditional techniques. Using the abundance and biomass of those taxa detected from morphological methodologies, we found a significant positive correlation with the number of reads obtained with metabarcoding approaches. The metabarcoding-based index derived from read counts, gAMBI, and the morphology-based index derived from individuals’ biomass, (B)AMBI, showed the best correlation and revealed excellent agreement at determining the ecological status of the stations analyzed. We calculated that, for the analysis of the 51 stations included in the Basque monitoring network, metabarcoding was 55% less costly and 72% less time consuming.

Nevertheless, these techniques require general methods to be tailored to the specific research objectives, as well as to substrate- and species-specific constraints.

Twenty-four faeces were collected in the field, DNA was extracted from them, and fragments of the standard barcode region (COI) were PCR amplified by using five primer sets (Brandon-Mong, Gillet, Leray, Meusnier and Zeale). PCR outputs were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform, sequences were processed, clustered into OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) using UPARSE algorithm and BLASTed against the NCBI database. Although all primer sets successfully amplified their target fragments, they differed considerably in the amounts of sequence reads, rough OTUs, and taxonomically assigned OTUs. Primer sets consistently identified a few abundant prey taxa, probably representing the staple food of the Pyrenean desman. However, they differed in the less common prey groups. Overall, the combination of Gillet and Zeale primer sets were most cost-effective to identify the widest taxonomic range of prey as well as the desman itself, which could be further improved stepwise by adding sequentially the outputs of Leray, Brandon-Mong and Meusnier primers.

Biodiversity has to be accurately evaluated to assess more precisely possible dam effects on fish populations, in particular on the most biodiverse rivers such as the Mekong River. To improve tools for fish biodiversity assessment, a methodological survey was performed in the surroundings of a recent hydropower dam in the Mekong basin, the Nam Theun 2 project. Results of two different approaches, experimental surface gillnets capture and environmental DNA metabarcoding assays based on 12S ribosomal RNA and cytochrome b, were compared during 3 years (2014-2016). Pitfalls and benefits were identified for each method but the combined use of both approaches indisputably allows describing more accurately fish diversity around the reservoir. Importantly, striking convergent results were observed for biodiversity reports. 75% of the fish species caught by gillnets (62/82) were shown by the metabarcoding study performed on DNA extracted from water samples. eDNA approach also revealed to be sensitive by detecting 30 supplementary species known as present before the dam construction but never caught by gillnets during 3 years. Furthermore, potential of the marker-genes study might be underestimated since it was not possible to assign some sequences at lower taxonomic levels. Although 121 sequences were generated for this study, a third of species in the area, that exhibits high endemism, are still unknown in DNA databases. Efforts to complete local reference libraries must continue to improve the taxonomic assignment quality when using the non-invasive and promising eDNA approach. These results are of broader interest because of increasing number of hydropower projects in the Mekong Basin. They reveal the crucial importance to sample tissues/ DNA of species before dam projects, i.e. before the species could become endangered and difficult to catch, to obtain more precise biomonitoring in the future as we believe eDNA metabarcoding will rapidly be integrated as a standard tool in such studies.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","260","13","12","30543655","e0208592",NA,NA,2018

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. The nucleotide variation in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene makes it ideal for assigning sequences to species. However, this variability also makes it difficult to design truly universal primers. Here, we present the forward primer “Sauron-S878,” specifically designed to facilitate library preparation for metabarcoding. This primer is modified to improve the coverage of terrestrial species compared to the primer mCOIintF, optimized for aquatic systems, which raised the in silico coverage from 74.4% to 98.3% of available NCBI sequences (perfect match in 3' region, up to three mismatches in remaining primer). When paired with the reverse primer “jgHCO2198” (fragment length ~313 bp), these primers amplified 98.4% of 255 tested DNA extracts from various taxa, which are better than many other common COI barcoding primers. Furthermore, a single-tube protocol was developed, wherein these primers amplify the target gene, and attach MIDs and Illumina sequencing adapters in one reaction. This eliminates the need for re-amplification or enzymatic ligation during library preparation while keeping the flexibility to modularly combine primers and MIDs. Using the single-tube approach, three replicates of three mock samples were sequenced on a MiSeq platform with no adverse effects compared to commercial Nextera indexing kits. From this run, 75% of all included taxa could be recovered, with no considerable bias among taxonomic groups. Despite the fact that 98.4% of the extracts were confirmed to amplify in vitro, this number was lower than expected. A reason for this discrepancy was a clear link between the relative concentration of a specific DNA type in the template and the number of returned reads for this DNA. We would argue that such a bias may be especially problematic in metabarcoding where samples usually contain trace DNA in unknown amounts. However, how this affects the completeness of metabarcoding results has yet been poorly investigated.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","diet analysis | DNA barcoding | environmental DNA | high-throughput sequencing | next-generation sequencing | primer bias","21100264002","P26144","Austrian Science Fund","1","TRUE","261","8","24",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Outputs from MiSeq were more sensitive and reproducible than those from Ion PGM due to a higher sequencing depth and sequence quality on MiSeq. DNA from intact prey taxa was detected more often (82% of the expected occurrences) than DNA from pet food (54%) and raw fish and meat (31%). We assumed that this variability was linked to different degree of DNA degradation: The Ion PGM detected significantly less human-linked food, birds, field voles, murids and shrews in the field-collected samples than the MiSeq platform. Pooling the replicates from both platforms and filtering the data allowed identification of at least one food item in 87.4% of the field-collected samples. Our DNA metabarcoding approach identified 29 prey taxa, of which 25 to species level (90% of items) including 9 rodents, 3 insectivores, 12 birds and 1 reptile and 33 human-related food taxa of which 23 were identified to genus level (75% of items). Our results demonstrate that using HTS platforms such as MiSeq, which provide reads of sufficiently high quantity and quality, with sufficient numbers of technical replicates, is a robust and non-invasive approach for further dietary studies on animals foraging on a wide range of food items in anthropogenic landscapes.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"21100200805","undefined","Singapore Police Force","1","TRUE","262","8","1","30459313","17091",NA,NA,2018

Cryptic organisms or those in early life stages can be difficult to distinguish by conventional morphological taxonomy. Molecular tools, such as metabarcoding, may improve their detection. In this study, the ability of morpho-taxonomy and metabarcoding (18S rRNA and COI) using three reference databases (PR2, BOLD and NCBI) to characterize biodiversity and detect non-indigenous species (NIS) in biofouling was compared on 60 passive samplers deployed over summer and winter in a New Zealand marina. Highest resolution of metazoan taxa was identified using 18S rRNA assigned to PR2. There were higher assignment rates to NCBI reference sequences, but poorer taxonomic identification. Using all methods, 48 potential NIS were identified. Metabarcoding detected the largest proportion of those NIS: 77% via 18S rRNA/PR2 and NCBI and 35% via COI/BOLD and NCBI. Morpho-taxonomy detected an additional 14% of all identified NIS comprising mainly of bryozoan taxa. The data highlight several on-going challenges, including: differential marker resolution, primer biases, incomplete sequence reference databases, and variations in bioinformatic pipelines.

Fecal DNA metabarcoding is currently used in various fields of ecology to determine animal diets. Contamination of non-food DNA from complex field environments is a considerable challenge to the reliability of this method but has rarely been quantified.

According to the results of generalized linear models, the probability of contamination was highest in samples placed in wet soil. The proportion of contaminant sequences was lowest at the earliest sampling point and was slightly higher in samples placed in open conditions. Exclusion of rare OTUs (operational taxonomic units) was effective for obtaining reliable dietary data from the obtained sequences, and a 1% cutoff reduced the percentage of contaminated samples to less than 30%. However, appropriate interpretation of the barcoding results considering inevitable contamination is an important issue to address.

Background: Chironomids, or non-biting midges, often dominate stream invertebrate communities in terms of biomass, abundance, and species richness and play an important role in riverine food webs. Despite these clear facts, the insect family Chironomidae is often treated as a single family in ecological studies or bioassessments given the difficulty to determine specimens further. We investigated stressor responses of single chironomid operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to three globally important stressors (increased salinity, fine sediment and reduced water flow velocity) in a highly replicated mesocosm experiment using a full-factorial design (eight treatment combinations with eight replicates each). Results: In total, 183 chironomid OTUs (97% similarity) were obtained by applying a quantitative DNA metabarcoding approach. Whereas on the typically applied family level, chironomids responded positively to added fine sediment and reduced water velocity in the streambed and negatively to reduced velocity in the leaf litter, an OTU-level analysis revealed a total of 15 different response patterns among the 35 most common OTUs only. The response patterns ranged from (a) insensitivity to any experimental manipulation over (b) highly specific sensitivities to only one stressor to (c) additive multiple-stressor effects and even (d) complex interactions. Conclusion: Even though most OTUs (> 85%) could not be assigned to a formally described species due to a lack of accurate reference data bases at present, the results indicate increased explanatory power with higher taxonomic resolution. Thus, our results highlight the potential of DNA-based approaches when studying environmental impacts, especially for this ecologically important taxon and in the context of multiple stressors.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Chironomidae | Field experiment | OTU | Stressor responses | Taxonomic resolution","19900191887","01LI1501","Swiss Barcode Of Life","1","TRUE","268","30","1",NA,"26",NA,NA,2018

A combined approach of metabarcoding analysis and multi-locus genetic characterization of isolated strains has been used for taxonomic designation and to study the genetic variability of this pathogen in France. Evidence indicates that four Colletotrichum species are associated with walnut in France: 3 belong to the C. acutatum species complex and 1 to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Results also show that C. godetiae is the most abundant species followed by C. fioriniae; while C. nymphaeae and another Colletotrichum sp. belonging to the C. gloeosporioides complex are found rarely. Representative isolates of detected species were also used to confirm pathogenicity on walnut fruits. The results show a high variability of lesion's dimensions among isolates tested.

Sediment bypass tunnels (SBTs) are guiding structures used to reduce sediment accumulation in reservoirs during high flows by transporting sediments to downstream reaches during operation. Previous studies monitoring the ecological effects of SBT operations on downstream reaches suggest a positive influence of SBTs on riverbed sediment conditions and macroinvertebrate communities based on traditional morphology-based surveys. Morphology-based macroinvertebrate assessments are costly and time-consuming, and the large number of morphologically cryptic, small-sized and undescribed species usually results in coarse taxonomic identification. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding analysis to assess the influence of SBT operations on macroinvertebrates downstream of SBT outlets by estimating species diversity and pairwise community dissimilarity between upstream and downstream locations in dam-fragmented rivers with operational SBTs in comparison to dam-fragmented (i.e., no SBTs) and free-flowing rivers (i.e., no dam). We found that macroinvertebrate community dissimilarity decreases with increasing operation time and frequency of SBTs. These factors of SBT operation influence changes in riverbed features, e.g. sediment relations, that subsequently effect the recovery of downstream macroinvertebrate communities to their respective upstream communities. Macroinvertebrate abundance using morphologically-identified specimens was positively correlated to read abundance using metabarcoding. This supports and reinforces the use of quantitative estimates for diversity analysis with metabarcoding data.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"21100200805","17H01666","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","1","TRUE","270","8","1",NA,"10185",NA,NA,2018

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding can greatly enhance our understanding of global biodiversity and our ability to detect rare or cryptic species. However, sampling effort must be considered when interpreting results from these surveys. We explored how sampling effort influenced biodiversity patterns and nonindigenous species (NIS) detection in an eDNA metabarcoding survey of four commercial ports. Overall, we captured sequences from 18 metazoan phyla with minimal differences in taxonomic coverage between 18 S and COI primer sets. While community dissimilarity patterns were consistent across primers and sampling effort, richness patterns were not, suggesting that richness estimates are extremely sensitive to primer choice and sampling effort. The survey detected 64 potential NIS, with COI identifying more known NIS from port checklists but 18 S identifying more operational taxonomic units shared between three or more ports that represent un-recorded potential NIS. Overall, we conclude that eDNA metabarcoding surveys can reveal global similarity patterns among ports across a broad array of taxa and can also detect potential NIS in these key habitats.

Current approaches also lack sensitivity to assess the full extent of this ecological diversity. Here we developed a metabarcoding approach based on next-generation sequencing to identify triatomine gut microbiome, vertebrate feeding hosts, and parasite diversity and their potential interactions. We detected a dynamic microbiome in Triatoma dimidiata, including 23 bacterial orders, which differed according to blood sources. Fourteen vertebrate species served as blood sources, corresponding to domestic, synantropic and sylvatic species, although four (human, dog, cow and mice) accounted for over 50% of blood sources. Importantly, bugs fed on multiple hosts, with up to 11 hosts identified per bug, indicating very frequent host-switching. A high clonal diversity of T. cruzi was detected, with up to 20 haplotypes per bug. This analysis provided much greater sensitivity to detect multiple blood meals and multiclonal infections with T. cruzi, which should be taken into account to develop transmission networks, and characterize the risk for human infection, eventually leading to a better control of disease transmission.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"21100200805","CB2015-258752","National Research Council of Science and Technology","1","TRUE","273","8","1",NA,"4140",NA,NA,2018

However, identification of all species within strongylid communities using traditional methods based on coproscopy or single nematode amplification and sequencing is virtually impossible. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies provide opportunities to generate large amounts of sequence data and enable analyses of samples containing a mixture of DNA from multiple species/genotypes. We designed and tested an HTS approach for strain-level identification of gastrointestinal strongylids using ITS-2 metabarcoding at the MiSeq Illumina platform in samples from two free-ranging non-human primate species inhabiting the same environment, but differing significantly in their host traits and ecology. Although we observed overlapping of particular haplotypes, overall the studied primate species differed in their strongylid nematode community composition. Using HTS, we revealed hidden diversity in the strongylid nematode communities in non-human primates, more than one haplotype was found in more than 90% of samples and coinfections of more than one putative species occurred in 80% of samples.

We introduce a method for assigning names to CO1 metabarcode sequences with confidence scores in a rapid, high-throughput manner. We compiled nearly 1 million CO1 barcode sequences appropriate for classifying arthropods and chordates. Compared to our previous Insecta classifier, the current classifier has more than three times the taxonomic coverage, including outgroups, and is based on almost five times as many reference sequences. Unlike other popular rDNA metabarcoding markers, we show that classification performance is similar across the length of the CO1 barcoding region. We show that the RDP classifier can make taxonomic assignments about 19 times faster than the popular top BLAST hit method and reduce the false positive rate from nearly 100% to 34%. This is especially important in large-scale biodiversity and biomonitoring studies where datasets can become very large and the taxonomic assignment problem is not trivial. We also show that reference databases are becoming more representative of current species diversity but that gaps still exist.

To investigate the influence of seasonality on Arctic marine virus communities, five research cruises to the west and north of Svalbard were conducted across one calendar year, collecting water from the surface to 1000 m in depth. We employed metabarcoding analysis of major capsid protein g23 and mcp genes in order to investigate T4-like myoviruses and large dsDNA viruses infecting prokaryotic and eukaryotic picophytoplankton, respectively. Microbial abundances were assessed using flow cytometry. Metabarcoding results demonstrated that seasonality was the key mediator shaping virus communities, whereas depth exerted a diversifying effect within seasonal virus assemblages. Viral diversity and virus-to-prokaryote ratios (VPRs) dropped sharply at the commencement of the spring bloom but increased across the season, ultimately achieving the highest levels during the winter season. These findings suggest that viral lysis may be an important process during the polar winter, when productivity is low. Furthermore, winter viral communities consisted of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) distinct from those present during the spring-summer season.

This is especially important for species that inhabit remote areas within biodiversity hotspots, with little information about their ecological roles. The emblematic giant wall gecko of Cabo Verde, Tarentola gigas, is restricted to the uninhabited Branco and Raso islets, and presents two subspecies. It is classified as Endangered, and locally Extinct on Santa Luzia Island; however, little information is known about its diet and behaviour. In this study, we identified the main plant, arthropods, and vertebrates consumed by both gecko subspecies using next generation sequencing (NGS) (metabarcoding of faecal pellets), and compared them with the species known to occur on Santa Luzia. Results showed that plants have a significant role as diet items and identified vertebrate and invertebrate taxa with higher taxonomic resolution than traditional methods. With this study, we now have data on the diet of both subspecies for evaluating the reintroduction of this threatened gecko on Santa Luzia as potentially successful, considering the generalist character of both populations. The information revealed by these ecological networks is important for the development of conservation plans by governmental authorities, and reinforces the essential and commonly neglected role of reptiles on island systems.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Conservation | Desertas islands | Diet | Metabarcoding | Protected areas | Tarentola gigas","19700188368","NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-AGRIGEN","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","1","TRUE","282","9","12",NA,"599",NA,NA,2018

Arthropod communities in the tropics are increasingly impacted by rapid changes in land use. Because species showing distinct seasonal patterns of activity are thought to be at higher risk of climate-related extirpation, global warming is generally considered a lower threat to arthropod biodiversity in the tropics than in temperate regions. To examine changes associated with land use and weather variables in tropical arthropod communities, we deployed Malaise traps at three major anthropogenic forests (secondary reserve forest, oil palm forest, and urban ornamental forest (UOF)) in Peninsular Malaysia and collected arthropods continuously for 12 months. We used metabarcoding protocols to characterize the diversity within weekly samples. We found that changes in the composition of arthropod communities were significantly associated with maximum temperature in all the three forests, but shifts were reversed in the UOF compared with the other forests. This suggests arthropods in forests in Peninsular Malaysia face a double threat: community shifts and biodiversity loss due to exploitation and disturbance of forests which consequently put species at further risk related to global warming. We highlight the positive feedback mechanism of land use and temperature, which pose threats to the arthropod communities and further implicates ecosystem functioning and human well-being. Consequently, conservation and mitigation plans are urgently needed.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","biodiversity | global warming | Insects | land-use | Malaise trap | metabarcoding","19704","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","284","108","6","29441836",NA,NA,"S000748531800010X",2018

Methods in Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society Plants regulate soils and microclimate, provide substrate for heterotrophic taxa, are easy to observe and identify and have a stable taxonomy, which strongly justifies their use as indicators in monitoring and conservation. However, there is no consensus as to whether plants are strong predictors of total multi-taxon species richness. In this study, we investigate if general terrestrial species richness can be predicted by vascular plant richness and bioindication. To answer this question, we collected an extensive dataset on species richness of vascular plants, bryophytes, macrofungi, lichens, plant-galling arthropods, gastropods, spiders, carabid beetles, hoverflies, and genetic richness (operational taxonomic units = OTUs) from environmental DNA metabarcoding. We also constructed a Conservation Index based on threatened red list species. Besides using richness of vascular plants for prediction of other taxonomic groups, we also used plant-derived calibration of the abiotic environment (moisture, soil fertility and light conditions) as well as the degree of anthropogenic impact. Bivariate relationships between plant species richness and other species groups showed no consistent pattern. After taking environmental calibration by bioindication into account, we found a consistent, and for most groups significant, positive effect of plant richness. Plant species richness was also important for richness of fungal OTUs, Malaise OTUs and for the Conservation Index. Our multiple regression analyses revealed (a) a consistently positive effect of plant richness on other taxa, (b) prediction of 12%–55% of variation in other taxa and 48% of variation in the total species richness when bioindication and plant richness were used as predictors. Our results justify that vascular plants are strong indicators of total biodiversity across environmental gradients and broad taxonomic realms and therefore a natural first choice for biodiversity monitoring and conservation planning.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","13","bryophytes | ecospace | fungi | gastropods | hoverflies | metabarcoding | spiders | surrogacy","21100217611","VKR-023343","Villum Fonden","1","TRUE","285","9","12",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

To reduce the exposure of cultured shellfish to potential pathogens, antibiotics can be used. However, risks associated with this practice have led to the development of alternative techniques such as ultraviolet (UV) light exposure for seawater disinfection. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to measure the effect of low (50 mJoules/cm 2 ) and high (200 mJoules/cm 2 ) UV treatment of seawater on the bacterial communities present in hatchery rearing water and in Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas larvae. 81 samples were collected between 13 and 29 March 2017 for high-throughput DNA sequencing of bacterial communities, including differentially-treated seawater, the microalgae fed to the oysters and oyster larvae (fertilized eggs, early veliger larval stage [D-larvae], and pre-settlement stage) samples. Differences in larval mortality between low and high UV treatments were also assessed. We found that the two UV treatments influenced the overall bacterial community diversity and affected its composition in both seawater and oyster larval samples. While alpha-diversity was mostly driven by the UV treatment, we found that the microbiome composition was primarily affected by temporal changes in the water source. Compared to the bacterial microbiome associated with seawater, the oyster larvae microbiome changed more significantly in response to both UV treatments and sampling dates with marked shifts in the dominant bacteria associated with fertilized eggs (class Gammaproteobacteria, families Rhodospirillaceae and Pelagibacteraceae), the D-larvae (family Alteromonadaceae), and the pre-settlement larvae (families Flavobacteriaceae and Rhodobacteraceae). As larval development progressed, an increasingly complex bacterial community structure was observed. These bacterial community changes were likely driven by multiple factors, including the microbiome associated with microalgal cultures, which increased in complexity over time. Despite the clear response of bacterial communities to both low and high UV treatments, no significant effect was observed in relation to the oyster larval mortality rate. These results suggest that increasing the UV treatment to 200 mJoules/cm 2 , if required for more efficacious disinfection and biosecurity, would not be detrimental to Pacific oyster larval survival. Further research is required to increase understanding of the dynamics of functionally critical bacterial taxa and their successive roles in post-larval development of Pacific oysters.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","16S ribosomal RNA gene | High-throughput sequencing | Larvae oyster rearing | Metabarcoding | Microbiome | UV treatment","29419","16388","Ministry for Business Innovation and Employment","0","FALSE","290","497",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0044848618307786",2018

The effectiveness of environmental protection measures is based on the early identification and diagnosis of anthropogenic pressures. Similarly, restoration actions require precise monitoring of changes in the ecological quality of ecosystems, in order to highlight their effectiveness. Monitoring the ecological quality relies on bioindicators, which are organisms revealing the pressures exerted on the environment through the composition of their communities. Their implementation, based on the morphological identification of species, is expensive because it requires time and experts in taxonomy. Recent genomic tools should provide access to reliable and high-throughput environmental monitoring by directly inferring the composition of bioindicators’ communities from their DNA (metabarcoding). The French-Swiss program SYNAQUA (INTERREG France-Switzerland 2017–2019) proposes to use and validate the tools of environmental genomic for biomonitoring and aims ultimately at their implementation in the regulatory bio-surveillance. SYNAQUA will test the metabarcoding approach focusing on two bioindicators, diatoms, and aquatic oligochaetes, which are used in freshwater biomonitoring in France and Switzerland. To go towards the renewal of current biomonitoring practices, SYNAQUA will (1) bring together different actors: scientists, environmental managers, consulting firms, and biotechnological companies, (2) apply this approach on a large scale to demonstrate its relevance, (3) propose robust and reliable tools, and (4) raise public awareness and train the various actors likely to use these new tools. Biomonitoring approaches based on such environmental genomic tools should address the European need for reliable, higher-throughput monitoring to improve the protection of aquatic environments under multiple pressures, guide their restoration, and follow their evolution.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","24","Aquatic oligochaetes | Bioindication | Diatoms | Metabarcoding | Water quality assessment","23918","undefined","European Regional Development Fund","0","FALSE","291","25","34","29732510",NA,"FEDER",NA,2018

The set of COI primers allowed amplification of mitochondrial minibarcodes for diverse metazoan phyla and the differentiation at the species level for more than 99% of the specimens in the dataset. Our results revealed that the number of sequences is not consistent with proportions in the given DNA mixture. Altogether, environmental sequences could be assigned to 114 species and to 12 metazoan phyla. A spatial distribution of taxa recovered by eDNA was congruent with known distributions.

Okinawa is the southwesternmost part of Japan and represents the northern limit of coral reefs that are influenced by the Kuroshio warm current. We have been studying two coral reefs off Sesoko Island, in northern Okinawa, to evaluate coral reef environments since 2014. In this study, we applied a metagenomic approach to analyze the seasonal composition of picophytoplankton at these two reef sites (Sesoko Minami and Ishikawabaru). The two sites were selected for their differences: Sesoko Minami faces the open ocean and experiences relatively small land effects, while Ishikawabaru experiences relatively high land effects and is surrounded by barrier reefs. Seawater samples were collected from these two sites and filtered through a 1.6 µm pore filter followed by a 0.2 µm membrane filter. DNA was extracted from the 0.2 µm filters, and the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene (260 bp) was amplified before sequencing using next-generation sequencing techniques. Cyanobacteria or chloroplast sequences were selected for further metabarcording analyses. Interestingly, almost no differences were indicated between the two sites and more than 95% of the picophytoplankton at both sampling sites was composed of only 5 to 7 OTUs. The seasonal composition of picophytoplankton clearly changed; in summer (Jul 2014, May to Jul 2015, and May to Aug 2016) OTU 1 (Synechococcus sp. NC007513) was most abundant. OTU 4 (Prochlorococcus marinus NC009091) also reached its maximum abundance in summer (May to Aug 2016), while OTU 6 (Bathycoccous prasinos FN563099) increased in winter. OTU 8 (Micromonas commoda RCC299 FJ858267) was present at every sampling period and accounted for 5–20% of the total picophytoplankton contig numbers.

Although animals are among the best studied organisms, we still lack a full description of their diversity, especially for microscopic taxa. This is partly due to the time-consuming and costly nature of surveying animal diversity through morphological and molecular studies of individual taxa. A powerful alternative is the use of high-throughput environmental sequencing, providing molecular data from all organisms sampled. We here address the unknown diversity of animal phyla in marine environments using an extensive dataset designed to assess eukaryotic ribosomal diversity among European coastal locations. A multi-phylum assessment of marine animal diversity that includes water column and sediments, oxic and anoxic environments, and both DNA and RNA templates, revealed a high percentage of novel 18S rRNA sequences in most phyla, suggesting that marine environments have not yet been fully sampled at a molecular level. This novelty is especially high among Platyhelminthes, Acoelomorpha, and Nematoda, which are well studied from a morphological perspective and abundant in benthic environments. We also identified, based on molecular data, a potentially novel group of widespread tunicates. Moreover, we recovered a high number of reads for Ctenophora and Cnidaria in the smaller fractions suggesting their gametes might play a greater ecological role than previously suspected.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"21100200805","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","295","8","1",NA,"9106",NA,NA,2018

The implementation of HTS (high-throughput sequencing) approaches is rapidly changing our understanding of the lichen symbiosis, by uncovering high bacterial and fungal diversity, which is often host-specific. Recently, HTS methods revealed the presence of multiple photobionts inside a single thallus in several lichen species. This differs from Sanger technology, which typically yields a single, unambiguous algal sequence per individual. Here we compared HTS and Sanger methods for estimating the diversity of green algal symbionts within lichen thalli using 240 lichen individuals belonging to two species of lichen-forming fungi. According to HTS data, Sanger technology consistently yielded the most abundant photobiont sequence in the sample. However, if the second most abundant photobiont exceeded 30% of the total HTS reads in a sample, Sanger sequencing generally failed. Our results suggest that most lichen individuals in the two analyzed species, Lasallia hispanica and L. pustulata, indeed contain a single, predominant green algal photobiont. We conclude that Sanger sequencing is a valid approach to detect the dominant photobionts in lichen individuals and populations. We discuss which research areas in lichen ecology and evolution will continue to benefit from Sanger sequencing, and which areas will profit from HTS approaches to assessing symbiont diversity.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"21100200805","UCM CT65/16",NA,"1","TRUE","296","8","1","29872090","8624",NA,NA,2018

The species-rich diatom family Chaetocerotaceae is common in the coastal marine phytoplankton worldwide where it is responsible for a substantial part of the primary production. Despite its relevance for the global cycling of carbon and silica, many species are still described only morphologically, and numerous specimens do not fit any described taxa. Nowadays, studies to assess plankton biodiversity deploy high throughput sequencing metabarcoding of the 18S rDNA V4 region, but to translate the gathered metabarcodes into biologically meaningful taxa, there is a need for reference barcodes. However, 18S reference barcodes for this important family are still relatively scarce. We provide 18S rDNA and partial 28S rDNA reference sequences of 443 morphologically characterized chaetocerotacean strains. We gathered 164 of the 216 18S sequences and 244 of the 413 28S sequences of strains from the Gulf of Naples, Atlantic France, and Chile. Inferred phylogenies showed 84 terminal taxa in seven principal clades. Two of these clades included terminal taxa whose rDNA sequences contained spliceosomal and Group IC1 introns. Regarding the commonly used metabarcode markers in planktonic diversity studies, all terminal taxa can be discriminated with the 18S V4 hypervariable region; its primers fit their targets in all but two species, and the V4-tree topology is similar to that of the 18S. Hence V4-metabarcodes of unknown Chaetocerotaceae are assignable to the family. Regarding the V9 hypervariable region, most terminal taxa can be discriminated, but several contain introns in their primer targets. Moreover, poor phylogenetic resolution of the V9 region affects placement of metabarcodes of putative but unknown chaetocerotacean taxa, and hence, uncertainty in taxonomic assignment, even of higher taxa.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"10600153309","RBAP10A2T4","Fondazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro","1","TRUE","297","13","12","30586452","e0208929","FIRC",NA,2018

Here we describe GoFish, a strategy for single-species environmental DNA (eDNA) presence/absence assays using nested PCR. The assays amplify a mitochondrial 12S rDNA segment with vertebrate metabarcoding primers, followed by nested PCR with M13-tailed, species-specific primers. Sanger sequencing confirms positives detected by gel electrophoresis. We first obtained 12S sequences from 77 fish specimens for 36 northwestern Atlantic taxa not well documented in GenBank. Using these and existing 12S records, we designed GoFish assays for 11 bony fish species common in the lower Hudson River estuary and tested seasonal abundance and habitat preference at two sites. Additional assays detected nine cartilaginous fish species and a marine mammal, bottlenose dolphin, in southern New York Bight. GoFish sensitivity was equivalent to Illumina MiSeq metabarcoding. Unlike quantitative PCR (qPCR), GoFish does not require tissues of target and related species for assay development and a basic thermal cycler is sufficient. Unlike Illumina metabarcoding, indexing and batching samples are unnecessary and advanced bioinformatics expertise is not needed. From water collection to Sanger sequencing results, the assay can be carried out in three days. The main limitations to this approach, which employs metabarcoding primers, are the same as for metabarcoding, namely, inability to distinguish species with shared target sequences and inconsistent amplification of rarer eDNA. In addition, the performance of the 20 assays reported here as compared to other single-species eDNA assays is not known. This approach will be a useful addition to current eDNA methods when analyzing presence/absence of known species, when turnaround time is important, and in educational settings.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"10600153309","undefined","Rockefeller University","1","TRUE","298","13","12","30533051","e0198717",NA,NA,2018

Altitudinal gradients provide valuable information about the effects of environmental variables on changes in species richness and composition as well as the distribution of below ground fungal communities. Since most knowledge in this respect has been gathered on aboveground communities, we focused our study towards the characterization of belowground fungal communities associated with two different ages of Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees along an altitudinal gradient. By sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region on the Illumina platform, we investigated the fungal communities in a floristically and geologically relatively well explored forest on the slope of Mt. Iseler of the Bavarian Alps. From fine roots and rhizosphere of a total of 90 of Norway spruce trees from 18 plots we detected 1285 taxa, with a range of 167 to 506 (average 377) taxa per plot. Fungal taxa are distributed over 96 different orders belonging to the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chrytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, and Mucoromycota. Overall the Agaricales (438 taxa) and Tremellales (81 taxa) belonging to the Basidiomycota and the Hypocreales (65 spp.) and Helotiales (61 taxa) belonging to the Ascomycota represented the taxon richest orders. The evaluation of our multivariate generalized mixed models indicate that the altitude has a significant influence on the composition of the fungal communities (p < 0.003) and that tree age determines community diversity (p < 0.05). A total of 47 ecological guilds were detected, of which the ectomycorrhizal and saprophytic guilds were the most taxon-rich. Our ITS amplicon Illumina sequencing approach allowed us to characterize a high fungal community diversity that would not be possible to capture with fruiting body surveys alone. We conclude that it is an invaluable tool for diverse monitoring tasks and inventorying biodiversity, especially in the detection of microorganisms developing very ephemeral and/or inconspicuous fruiting bodies or lacking them all together. Results suggest that the altitude mainly influences the community composition, whereas fungal diversity becomes higher in mature/ older trees. Finally, we demonstrate that novel techniques from bacterial microbiome analyses are also useful for studying fungal diversity and community structure in a DNA metabarcoding approach, but that incomplete reference sequence databases so far limit effective identification.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"10600153309","OB 24/30-1","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","1","TRUE","299","13","12","30517179","e0208493","DFG",NA,2018

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. All organisms are challenged by encounters with parasites, which strongly select for efficient escape strategies in the host. The threat is especially high for gregarious species entering immobile periods, such as diapause. Larvae of the Glanville fritillary butterfly, Melitaea cinxia, spend the winter in diapause in groups of conspecifics each sheltered in a silk nest. Despite intensive monitoring of the population, we have little understanding of the ecological factors influencing larval survival over the winter in the field. We tested whether qualitative and quantitative properties of the silk nest contribute to larval survival over diapause. We used comparative proteomics, metabarcoding analyses, microscopic imaging, and in vitro experiments to compare protein composition of the silk, community composition of the silk-associated microbiota, and silk density from both wild-collected and laboratory-reared families, which survived or died in the field. Although most traits assessed varied across families, only silk density was correlated with overwinter survival in the field. The silk nest spun by gregarious larvae before the winter acts as an efficient breathable physical shield that positively affects larval survival during diapause. Such benefit may explain how this costly trait is conserved across populations of this butterfly species and potentially across other silk-spinning insect species.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","diapause | electron microscopy | mass spectrometry | microbiota | winter-nest","21100264002","273098","Academy of Finland","1","TRUE","300","8","24",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Plant pathogen richness was significantly greater in middens deposited during the Central Andean Pluvial Event (CAPE); a period of increased precipitation between 17.5–8.5 ka. Moreover, the occurrence frequency of Pucciniaceae (rust fungi) was significantly greater during the CAPE, and the highest relative abundances for five additional potentially pathogenic taxa also occurred during this period.

Understanding the unique ecological roles played by highly connected organisms and the consequences of their loss requires a comprehensive understanding of the functional redundancy amongst organisms. One important, yet poorly understood, food web is that between truffle-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi and their mammalian consumers and dispersers. Mammalian fungal specialists rely on fungi as a food source, and they consume and disperse a higher diversity and abundance of fungi than do mycophagous mammals with generalist diets. Therefore, we hypothesize that mammalian fungal specialists are functionally distinct because they disperse a set of fungal taxa not fully nested within the set consumed by the combined generalist mammalian community (i.e., functional redundancy of fungal dispersal is limited). Using high-throughput sequencing, we compared the fungal composition of 93 scats from the endangered fungal specialist northern bettong (Bettongia tropica) and 120 scats from nine co-occurring generalist mammal species across three sites and three seasons. Compared with other generalist mammals, B. tropica consumed a more diverse fungal diet with more unique taxa. This aligns with our hypothesis that B. tropica performs a unique dispersal function for ectomycorrhizal truffle fungi. Additionally, modelling of mammalian extinctions predicted rapid loss of food web connections which could result in loss of gene flow for truffle taxa. Our results suggest that this system is sensitive to the extinction of highly connected specialist species like B. tropica and their loss could have consequences for ectomycorrhizal truffle fungal diversity. This suggests that the conservation of fungal specialists is imperative to maintaining ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and healthy plant–mycorrhizal relationships.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Bettongia tropica | dispersal | food web | functional redundancy | metabarcoding | truffle fungi","20297","916","WWF International","0","FALSE","303","27","23","30375068",NA,NA,NA,2018

Reduced decomposition has been accompanied by altered structure and function of fungal communities, the primary decomposers in forest ecosystems; however, a mechanistic understanding of fungal responses to chronic N enrichment is lacking. A reduction in soil and litter manganese (Mn) concentrations under N enrichment (i.e., Mn limitation) may help explain these observations, because Mn is a cofactor and regulator of lignin-decay enzymes produced by fungi. We conducted a laboratory study to evaluate the effect of Mn availability on decomposition dynamics in chronically N-enriched soils. We measured litter mass loss, lignin relative abundance, and lignin-decay enzyme activities, and characterized the litter fungal community by ITS2 metabarcoding. We observed a significant positive correlation between Mn availability and lignin-decay enzyme activities. In addition, long-term (28 years) N enrichment increased the relative abundance of ‘weak’ decomposers (e.g., yeasts), but this response was reversed with Mn amendment, suggesting that higher Mn availability may promote fungal communities better adapted to decompose lignin.

All rights reserved. The soil decomposer community is a primary driver of carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. Understanding the processes that structure this community is critical to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. In North American forests, soil fungal communities are regulated by grazing soil invertebrates, which are in turn controlled by the predatory red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus). The presence of these soil invertebrate taxa is known to exert direct top-down control via selective grazing on saprotrophic fungi, with direct consequences for biogeochemical cycling in soil. We investigated whether the removal of P. cinereus would relieve top-down control on decomposer fungal communities in a tri-trophic mesocosm study. Fungal communities were characterized using metabarcoding and high-throughput DNA sequencing. The ß-diversity of fungal communities differed between salamander presence and absence treatments with a strong effect on saprotrophic fungal communities. We concluded that P. cinereus, a mesopredator in the detritivore food chain, exerts a prominent control on the composition and functional diversity of fungal communities in soil through a multi-trophic top-down process. Given their capacity to govern the compositions of soil invertebrates, the activity of these amphibians may be important for regulating ecosystem function and nutrient cycling in temperate forest systems.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Biogeochemical cycling | Carbon cycle | Plethodon cinereus | Red-backed salamander | Saprophytic fungi | Terrestrial mesopredator","19705","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","306","94","12","30247565","fiy168",NA,NA,2018

Fecal contamination of recreational waters (i.e. lakes, rivers, beaches) poses an on-going problem for environmental and public health. Heavy rainfall can exacerbate existing problems with fecal contamination. As there could be variable sources of fecal contamination, identifying the source is critical for remediation efforts. This study utilized microbial source tracking (MST), chemical source tracking (CST) markers and environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to profile sampling areas and identify sources of fecal contamination in creek, stormwater outfall and beach sites in the Etobicoke Creek watershed (Toronto, ON). Water samples were collected before and immediately following an extreme rain event. MST and CST identified stormwater outfalls as an important source of human fecal contamination during dry and wet conditions. eDNA metabarcoding allowed for potential identification of additional sources of fecal contamination and provided additional evidence of human fecal contamination. The extreme rainfall event altered the eDNA profiles, causing creek and beach sites to reflect a greater diversity of mammal and bird eDNA sequences.

Diversity of microbial organisms is linked to global climatic gradients. The genus Phytophthora includes both aquatic and terrestrial plant pathogenic species that display a large variation of functional traits. The extent to which the physical environment (water or soil) modulates the interaction of microorganisms with climate is unknown. Here, we explored the main environmental drivers of diversity and functional trait composition of Phytophthora communities. Communities were obtained by a novel metabarcoding setup based on PacBio sequencing of river filtrates in 96 river sites along a geographical gradient. Species were classified as terrestrial or aquatic based on their phylogenetic clade. Overall, terrestrial and aquatic species showed contrasting patterns of diversity. For terrestrial species, precipitation was a stronger driver than temperature, and diversity and functional diversity decreased with decreasing temperature and precipitation. In cold and dry areas, the dominant species formed resistant structures and had a low optimum temperature. By contrast, for aquatic species, temperature and water chemistry were the strongest drivers, and diversity increased with decreasing temperature and precipitation. Within the same area, environmental filtering affected terrestrial species more strongly than aquatic species (20% versus 3% of the studied communities, respectively). Our results highlight the importance of functional traits and the physical environment in which microorganisms develop their life cycle when predicting their distribution under changing climatic conditions. Temperature and rainfall may be buffered differently by water and soil, and thus pose contrasting constrains to microbial assemblies.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"5800173382","215-2012-1255","Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas","1","TRUE","311","12","12","30072746",NA,NA,NA,2018

Among soil-inhabiting protists, myxomycetes stand out by their macroscopic fructifications which have allowed studies on their ecology and distribution for more than two hundred years. One of the most distinct ecological guilds in myxomycetes are the nivicolous or “snowbank” myxomycete species, which produce fruit bodies at the edge of melting snowbanks in spring. Relationship between the occurrence of fructifications and myxamoebae remain unknown. In this study we used modern molecular techniques, by direct DNA amplification from soil extracts (NGS metabarcoding) to compare the distribution of soil-inhabiting myxamoebae found in 2016 with fructifications from the same sites collected over the course of four years (2013, 2015–17) along an elevational transect in the northern German Alps. A coherent community composition between fructification and soil myxamoebae, though with species-specific differences in relative abundance, was revealed. Although patterns varied among species, myxamoebae were found at both low and high elevations, whereas fruit bodies were mainly found at higher elevations, likely explained by the presence of a stable and long-lasting snow cover. In addition, a year to year comparison of fructification records support the hypothesis that the abundance of fructifications strongly depends on the onset of snowfall in the previous autumn and the soil temperature regime throughout the winter.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"21100200805","AM","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","1","TRUE","312","8","1",NA,"11662",NA,NA,2018

It is well understood that homopolymer regions should be avoided for primer binding to prevent off-target amplification. However, in metabarcoding, it is often difficult to avoid primer degeneracy in order to maximize taxa detection. We here investigate primer binding specificity using different primer sets from several invertebrate metabarcoding studies. Our results indicate that primers frequently bound 1-2 bp upstream in taxa where a homopolymer region was present in the amplification direction. Primer binding 1 bp downstream was observed less frequently. This primer slippage leads to taxon-specific length variation in amplicons and subsequent length variation in recovered sequences. Some widely used primer sets were severely affected by this bias, while others were not. While this variation will only have small impacts on the designation of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) by clustering algorithms that ignore terminal gaps, primer sets employed in metabarcoding projects should be evaluated for their sensitivity to slippage. Moreover, steps should be taken to reduce slippage by improving protocols for primer design. For example, the flanking region adjacent to the 3' end of the primer is not considered by current primer development software although GC clamps in this position could mitigate slippage.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"21100200805","undefined","Canada First Research Excellence Fund","1","TRUE","313","8","1",NA,"10999",NA,NA,2018

Diatoms and haptophytes are two major phytoplankton groups, playing pivotal roles in global biogeochemical cycles and marine ecosystems. In general, diatoms have higher growth rates than haptophytes, whereas haptophytes tend to have higher nutrient uptake affinity. However, precise linkages between their ecological traits and geographical distributions remain poorly understood. Herein, we examined the basin-scale variability of the abundance and taxonomic composition of these two phytoplankton groups across 35 sites in the Pacific Ocean using DNA metabarcoding. The diatom community was generally dominated by a few genera at each sample site, whereas the haptophyte community consisted of a large number of genera in most of the sites. The coexistence of various haptophyte genera might be achieved by diversification of their ecophysiological traits such as mixotrophy. On the other hand, the diatom community might experience greater inter-genus competition due to the rapid uptake of nutrients. Our data further supports the notion that their distinct ecological strategies underlie the emergence of contrasting diversity patterns of these phytoplankton groups in the central Pacific at a basin scale.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"21100200805","24121004","Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation, Yale School of Medicine","1","TRUE","314","8","1",NA,"10916",NA,NA,2018

Comparisons with long-term electrofishing surveys demonstrated the ability of eDNA metabarcoding to qualitatively and quantitatively reveal fish assemblage structures (relative species abundance) but eDNA integrated a larger space than the classical sampling location. Combination of a literature review and field data showed that eDNA behaves in the water column like fine particulate organic matter.

Information about species distribution is crucial to ecological studies. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has recently been used to estimate the distribution of aquatic organisms. Several analytical methods including metabarcoding and species-specific PCR are being used for eDNA analysis. However, when only a few species are targeted, metabarcoding is not cost-effective because of the wasted consumption of read due to amplification of non-target species DNA. On the other hand, species-specific PCR requires tests to be repeated multiple times resulting in consuming more DNA templates, and experimental consumables. Here we propose a methodological framework for simultaneously detecting a few species using real-time multiplex PCR. We developed the species-specific primer-probe sets for two species of Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes and o. sakaizumii), and we used them in the real-time multiplex PCR. In aquarium experiment, even when the species abundances were biased, both species were simultaneously detected in all samples.

To this end, we applied a set of universal PCR primers (MiBird, a modified version of fish/mammal universal primers) for metabarcoding avian eDNA. We confirmed the versatility of MiBird primers by performing in silico analyses and by amplifying DNAs extracted from bird tissues. Analyses of water samples from zoo cages of birds with known species composition suggested that the use of MiBird primers combined with Illumina MiSeq could successfully detect avian species from water samples.

Cephalopods are primarily active predators throughout life. Flying squids (family Ommastrephidae) represents the most widely distributed and ecologically important family of cephalopods. While the diets of adult flying squids have been extensively studied, the first feeding diet of early paralarvae remains a mystery. The morphology of this ontogenetic stage notably differs from other cephalopod paralarvae, suggesting a different feeding strategy. Here, a combination of Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) and DNA metabarcoding of wild-collected paralarvae gut contents for eukaryotic 18S v9 and prokaryotic 16S rRNA was applied, covering almost every life domain. The gut contents were mainly composed by fungus, plants, algae and animals of marine and terrestrial origin, as well as eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms commonly found in fecal pellets and particulate organic matter. This assemblage of gut contents is consistent with a diet based on detritus. The ontogenetic shift of diet from detritivore suspension feeding to active predation represents a unique life strategy among cephalopods and allows ommastrephid squids to take advantage of an almost ubiquitous and accessible food resource during their early stages. LCM was successfully applied for the first time to tiny, wild-collected marine organisms, proving its utility in combination with DNA metabarcoding for dietary studies.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"21100200805","AGL2012-39077","Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte","1","TRUE","319","8","1",NA,"3440",NA,NA,2018

Here, we document the existence of Symbiodinium (i.e., now the family Symbiodiniaceae [2]) in tropical- and temperate-surface oceans using DNA and RNA metabarcoding of size-fractionated plankton samples collected at 109 stations across the globe. Symbiodinium from clades A and C were, by far, the most prevalent and widely distributed lineages (representing 0.1% of phytoplankton reads), while other lineages (clades B, D, E, F, and G) were present but rare. Concurrent metatranscriptomics analyses using the Tara Oceans gene catalog [3] revealed that Symbiodinium clades A and C were transcriptionally active in the open ocean and expressed core metabolic pathways (e.g., photosynthesis, carbon fixation, glycolysis, and ammonium uptake). Metabarcodes and expressed genes of clades A and C were detected in small and large plankton size fractions, suggesting the existence of a free-living population and a symbiotic lifestyle within planktonic hosts, respectively. However, high-resolution genetic markers and microscopy are required to confirm the life history of oceanic Symbiodinium. Overall, the previously unknown, metabolically active presence of Symbiodinium in oceanic waters opens up new avenues for investigating the potential of this oceanic reservoir to repopulate coral reefs following stress-induced bleaching. Decelle et al. show that the reef-building coral symbiont Symbiodinium occurs in the world's oceanic waters far from reef ecosystems. Clades A and C are the dominant Symbiodinium lineages in the ocean. Their gene expression for core metabolic pathways in small and large plankton fractions suggests both free-living and symbiotic lifestyles.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","coral reefs | marine plankton | metabarcoding | metatranscriptomics | open ocean | phytoplankton | Symbiodinium | symbiosis | Tara Oceans","15537","ANR-10-INBS-09","Communauté Université Grenoble Alpes","0","FALSE","321","28","22","30416058",NA,NA,"S0960982218312193",2018

Previously, this method has been successfully used to target spatial variation of eukaryote communities in marine sediments, however, the temporal changes in these communities remain understudied. Here, we follow the temporal changes of the eukaryote communities in Baltic Sea surface sediments collected from two coastal localities during three seasons of two consecutive years. Our study reveals that the structure of the sediment eukaryotic ecosystem was primarily driven by annual and seasonal changes in prevailing environmental conditions, whereas spatial variation was a less significant factor in explaining the variance in eukaryotic communities over time. Therefore, our data suggests that shifts in regional climate regime or large-scale changes in the environment are the overdriving factors in shaping the coastal eukaryotic sediment ecosystems rather than small-scale changes in local environmental conditions or heterogeneity in ecosystem structure. More studies targeting temporal changes are needed to further understand the long-term trends in ecosystem stability and response to climate change. Furthermore, this work contributes to the recent efforts in developing metabarcoding applications for environmental biomonitoring, proving a comprehensive option for traditional monitoring approaches.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","18S rRNA gene | Metabarcoding | Next-generation sequencing | Sediment | Temporal variation","19705","304006","Walter ja Andrée de Nottbeckin Säätiö","0","FALSE","322","95","1",NA,"fiy226",NA,NA,2018

In order to identify the phytoplankton cyst assemblages, thirteen surface sediment samples were collected from different sites in the Black Sea. The diversity of the resting stages was assessed using high-throughput sequencing metabarcoding (V7-9 hypervariable region of the 18S rDNA). One hundred and eighty microalgal species were identified with high level of similarity to the reference sequences. Dinoflagellates were dominated by Biecheleria, Gymnodinium and Karlodinium.

High-throughput sequencing-based metabarcoding provides a powerful tool to reveal complex interactions between environments and biological communities. Among many technical issues, the clustering strategies for operational taxonomic units (OTUs) which are crucial for assessing biodiversity of communities, may affect final conclusions. Here, we used zooplankton communities along an environmental pollution gradient in the Chaobai River in Northern China to test different clustering strategies, including nonclustering and clustering with varied thresholds. Our results showed that though the number of OTUs estimated by nonclustering strategies and clustering strategies with divergence thresholds of 99%–97% largely varied, they were able to identify the same set of significant environmental and spatial variables responsible for geographical distributions of zooplankton communities. In addition, the ecological conclusions obtained by clustering thresholds of 99%–97% were consistent with nonclustering strategies, where for all eight clustering scenarios we detected that species sorting predicted by environmental variables overrode dispersal as the dominant factor in structuring zooplankton communities. However, clustering with the divergence thresholds of <95% affected the environmental and spatial variables identified. We conclude that both newly developed nonclustering methods and traditional clustering methods with divergence thresholds =97% were reliable to reveal mechanisms of complex community–environment interactions, although different clustering strategies could lead to largely varied biodiversity estimates such as those for a-diversity.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","metabarcoding | operational taxonomic unit | river ecosystem | threshold | water pollution | zooplankton","11700154306","2017M620927","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","0","FALSE","326","18","6","29978606",NA,NA,NA,2018

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. European hake (Merluccius merluccius) is one of the most economically important fish for the Mediterranean Sea. It is an important predator of deep upper shelf slope communities currently characterized by growth overexploitation: the understanding of hake's diet might support next generation management tools. However, all current European hake diet studies depend on the morphological identification of prey remains in stomach content, with consequent limitations. In this study, we set up a metabarcoding approach based on cytochrome oxidase I PCR amplification and Miseq Illumina paired-end sequencing of M. merluccius stomach content remains and compared the results to classic morphological analyses. A total of 95 stomach contents of M. merluccius sampled in the North-Central Adriatic Sea were analyzed with both the metabarcoding and morphological approaches. Metabarcoding clearly outperformed the morphological method in the taxonomic identification of prey describing more complex trophic relationships even when considering the morphological identification of 200 stomach contents. Statistical analysis of diet composition revealed a weak differentiation among the hake's size classes, confirming an opportunistic feeding behavior. All the analyses performed showed the presence of a core of shared prey among the size classes and a cloud of size-specific prey. Our study highlights the exceptional potential of metabarcoding as an approach to provide unprecedented taxonomic resolution in the diet of M. merluccius and potentially of other marine predators, due to the broad-spectrum of detection of the primers used. A thorough description of these complex trophic relationships is fundamental for the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Adriatic Sea | European hake | feeding habits | Merluccius merluccius | metabarcoding","21100264002","undefined","National Council for Scientific Research","1","TRUE","328","8","21",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Increased marker lengths provide greater taxonomic resolution and allow for phylogenetic methods of classification, but longer reads may be subject to higher rates of sequencing error and chimera formation. In addition, most bioinformatics tools for DNA metabarcoding were designed for short reads and are therefore unsuitable. Here, we used Pacific Biosciences circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to DNA-metabarcode environmental samples using a ca. 4,500 bp marker that included most of the eukaryote SSU and LSU rRNA genes and the complete ITS region. We developed an analysis pipeline that reduced error rates to levels comparable to short-read platforms. Validation using a mock community indicated that our pipeline detected 98% of chimeras de novo. We recovered 947 OTUs from water and sediment samples from a natural lake, 848 of which could be classified to phylum, 397 to genus and 330 to species. By allowing for the simultaneous use of three databases (Unite, SILVA and RDP LSU), long-read DNA metabarcoding provided better taxonomic resolution than any single marker. We foresee the use of long reads enabling the cross-validation of reference sequences and the synthesis of ribosomal rRNA gene databases.

First, OTUs sequences are inserted within a reference phylogeny. Second, OTUs’ ecological profiles are estimated on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships with reference species whose ecology is known. Based on these ecological profiles, biotic indices can be computed using all available OTUs.

Due to uncertainty regarding the accuracy of methods traditionally used to estimate harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) diet it is necessary to improve analysis methods. We investigated the diet of harbour seals hauling out in an estuary area in north-western Iceland between May and August of 2010 and 2011 by genetic (molecular) analysis of prey in faeces using DNA metabarcoding. The results were compared to previously published results from morphological analysis. Our results showed that species consumed were mainly sandeels (Ammodytes sp.), flatfishes (Pleuronectidae), gadoids (Gadidae), herring (Clupea harengus) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). The results from molecular and morphological analyses were similar in regards to important prey species, but species diversity was lower in the morphological analysis and 38% of the samples included prey items that were unidentifiable in the morphological analysis. Notably, despite Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) availability in the study area, neither of the methods found evidence of salmonids in the harbour seal diet. Recently, a severe decline has been observed in the Icelandic harbour seal population.

Therefore, we compared metabarcoding results from bulk and eDNA samples taken from 19 streams spanning a wide gradient of farming intensities in New Zealand. We performed PCR with highly degenerate cytochrome c oxidase I primers and sequenced libraries on an Illumina MiSeq. The inferred community composition differed strongly between the two methods. More taxa were captured by eDNA than bulk-sample metabarcoding (5,819 vs. 1,483), but more of the commonly used invertebrate bioindicator taxa (mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies) were found in bulk (47) than eDNA samples (37). Catchment-wide and local land use impacts on communities were detected better by eDNA metabarcoding, especially for non-metazoan taxa. Our findings imply that bulk-sample metabarcoding resembles classical freshwater biomonitoring approaches better, as more indicator macroinvertebrate taxa are captured. However, eDNA metabarcoding might be better suited to infer the impact of stressors on stream ecosystems at larger scales, as many new and potentially more informative taxa are registered.

There is increasing interest in finding new, more efficient methods for routine monitoring of anthropogenic effects on benthic biodiversity and ecosystems. A range of molecular methods have been developed for assessing biodiversity the last decades. Particularly interesting are microarrays targeting phylogenetic marker genes, such as the small subunit of ribosomal RNA in eukaryotes (18S rRNA). This method can detect a large number of taxonomic groups in several samples simultaneously within a relatively short time and has the potential for incorporation in automated remote sensing pipelines. In this study we developed and tested a microarray for eukaryotes in marine sediments. The probes were designed to target 18S rRNA OTUs obtained through metabarcoding of marine sediments. The resulting microarray was tested using both a spiked sample consisting of 50 plasmid-clones and further, samples of genomic DNA extracted from marine sediments. We developed a filtration pipeline to eliminate noise and reduce the number of false positives, making it possible to detect and quantify most of the OTUs with = 0.1% abundance in the spiked sample. Our data indicated that the microarray was specific at higher taxonomic levels. However, the specificity decreased with increasing sequence similarity suggesting cross-hybridization between closely related OTUs. When using genomic DNA isolated from marine sediment there was a positive correlation between hybridization intensity signals and abundance of sequencing reads, suggesting a quantitative behavior of the microarray. Overall, the data suggest a potential for microarrays as a tool for high throughput sediment monitoring.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Benthic | Biodiversity | Ecosystem | Environment | Genomic DNA | Microarray | Monitoring | Probe","20235","190265/S40","Statoil","0","FALSE","337","154",NA,"30336165",NA,NA,"S0167701218308297",2018

Our results on diet composition remain mostly unchanged when using either read counts as a proxy for quantitative diet or presence–absence data, indicating a strong biological pattern. We conclude that although bats share major components in their ecology (nocturnal life style, insectivory, and echolocation), species differ in feeding behavior, suggesting bats may have distinctive evolutionary strategies.

Costs and ecological value of eDNA-based methods have rarely been evaluated in tropical regions, where high species richness is accompanied by high functional diversity (e.g., the use of different microhabitats by different species and life stages). We first tested whether estimation of tropical frogs' community structure derived from eDNA data is compatible with expert field assessments. Next, we evaluated whether eDNA is a financially viable solution for biodiversity monitoring in tropical regions. We applied eDNA metabarcoding to investigate frog species occurrence in five ponds in the Chiquitano dry forest region in Bolivia and compared our data with a simultaneous visual and audio encounter survey (VAES). We found that taxon lists and community structure generated with eDNA and VAES correspond closely, and most deviations are attributable to different species' life histories. Cost efficiency of eDNA surveys was mostly influenced by the richness of local fauna and the number of surveyed sites: VAES may be less costly in low-diversity regions, but eDNA quickly becomes more cost-efficient in high-diversity regions with many sites sampled. The results highlight that eDNA is suitable for large-scale biodiversity surveys in high-diversity areas if life history is considered, and certain precautions in sampling, genetic analyses and data interpretation are taken.

However, current amplicon sequencing-based barcoding approaches are usually restricted to short, single-locus fragments, limiting their taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution. Here, we establish a cost efficient and simple multiplex PCR protocol for arthropod systematics by Illumina amplicon sequencing. We introduce primer sets, including several new, generic primers, to reliably amplify nine loci across a wide range of arthropods. Using a diverse collection of arthropod species from 19 orders, we test loci for amplification efficiency and estimate the effect of cross-species amplification bias on taxon recovery from bulk community samples. We then explore the taxonomic and phylogenetic utility of the primer sets, focusing on a dataset of spiders that includes both deep and recent divergences. The set of loci provides good phylogenetic support across a wide taxonomic spectrum, making it a useful addition to COI for resolving lineages within a comparative context. All loci recover sequences for the majority of arthropod taxa in separate PCRs. However, cross-species amplification bias in some primers prevents an exhaustive taxon recovery from bulk community samples. Our protocol makes it possible to generate multilocus datasets for large numbers of arthropod taxa for a fraction of the price and workload of Sanger sequencing. This opens up the possibility for parallel phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis of large collections of arthropods, but also enables rapid exploratory analyses of target lineages. Primers for metabarcoding applications should be carefully evaluated for their performance in bulk community samples and chosen to minimize cross-species amplification bias.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","arthropods | DNA barcoding | illumina amplicon sequencing | metabarcoding | multiplex PCR | spiders","21100217611","NSF DEB 1241253","National Science Foundation","0","FALSE","341","9","11",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

However, animal DNA in the environment tends to be comparatively rare, making it necessary to enrich for genetic targets from focal taxa prior to sequencing. Current metabarcoding approaches for enrichment rely on bulk amplification using conserved primer annealing sites, which can result in skewed relative sequence abundance and failure to detect some taxa because of PCR bias. Here, we test capture enrichment via hybridization as an alternative strategy for target enrichment using a series of experiments on environmental samples and laboratory-generated, known-composition DNA mixtures. Capture enrichment resulted in detecting multiple species in both kinds of samples, and postcapture relative sequence abundance accurately reflected initial relative template abundance. However, further optimization is needed to permit reliable species detection at the very low-DNA quantities typical of environmental samples (<0.1 ng DNA).

Sacoglossa, the “sap sucking” sea slugs, are highly specialized herbivores and the only metazoans that exhibit kleptoplasty, the sequestration and retention of chloroplasts from algae. Plakobranchus is one of the most generalistic herbivores within this order, with as many as 12 reported “algal host” (i.e. kleptoplast source) species. However, kleptoplast diversity studies conducted on Plakobranchus to date most likely underestimated the full diversity of kleptoplast sources within the studied populations due to limitations of the molecular techniques employed. Here, we apply a high throughput sequencing technique to assess kleptoplast diversity of Plakobranchus cf. ianthobapsus’ from 10 sites across the Main Hawaiian Islands during winter and summer seasons. In so doing, we effectively used P. cf. ianthobapsus as a novel sampling tool to explore diminutive algal communities, including the current distribution of the invasive alga “Avrainvillea amadelpha.” Our results show that P. cf. ianthobapsus sequesters chloroplasts from 23 algal species from across the siphonous green algal order Bryopsidales. We identified “Avrainvillea amadelpha” and Codium edule as new host species for P. cf. ianthobapusus, but their rarity among the data suggests they were most likely less preferential as hosts and were possibly utilized due to low abundance or unavailability of more preferable species, and therefore a response to starvation risk. Additionally, the identification of the highly invasive siphonous green alga “A. amadelpha” as a kleptoplast source provides new fine-scale range and distribution data for this problematic species. Overall kleptoplast diversity does not differ among sites, except in a coral-dominated, (i.e. not algal dominated) environment, suggesting that siphonous algal assemblages are common in algal-dominated ecosystems in the Hawaiian Islands. Diversity dissimilarity among seasons was recovered from the majority of sites sampled, supporting the need for seasonal data collection in algal diversity assessments. This case study using metabarcoding of sacoglossan kleptoplasts provides deeper insights into these plant-animal interactions with a better understanding of host use than previous studies using traditional molecular methods and illustrates how algal diversity studies on the scale of plastids can have implications for understanding algal community structure and invasive species dynamics.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","Avrainvillea | Hawai‘i | Metabarcoding | rbcL","18965","undefined","Phycological Society of America","0","FALSE","344","128",NA,"30031771",NA,NA,"S105579031830054X",2018

Our method reduces costs of library preparation to $1.42 per sample, a 58% reduction compared to existing automated methods and a 21-fold reduction from commercial kits, without compromising sequencing success or distorting the microbial community composition analysis. We further validated the optimized method by sampling five body sites from 46 Pacific chub mackerel fish caught across 16 sampling events over seven months from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier in La Jolla, CA. Fish microbiome samples were processed with the miniaturized 5-µl reaction volume with 0.2 µl of genomic DNA (gDNA) and the standard 25-µl reaction volume with 1 µl of gDNA. Between the two methods, alpha diversity was highly correlated (R2 > 0.95), while distances of technical replicates were much lower than withinbody- site variation (P < 0.0001), further validating the method.

However, the effect of higher trophic levels on microbial decomposer communities and rate of decomposition is poorly understood. We therefore conducted an exclusion experiment to test the effect of invertebrates on fungal decomposer communities in dead wood, repeated at 30 sites in two landscapes, and measured wood density to assess effect on decay rate. Invertebrates were excluded from recently cut logs by cages with a 1-mm-mesh net, and fungal communities in caged logs were compared to logs accessible to invertebrates by DNA metabarcoding analyses. Accessible logs included control logs, cage control logs and positive control logs. We found that exclusion of invertebrates had a significant effect on fungal community composition. For example, the wood decay fungi Trametes versicolor and T. ochraceawere significantly more abundant in accessible logs than in caged logs. The strongest effect on fungal community composition, however, was attributed to differing baseline conditions in the individual trees. When accounting for these baseline differences, caged logs had significantly higher wood density than control logs after 2 years, indicating lower rates of wood decay in caged logs. Further studies, spanning several years, are required to fully understand the influence of invertebrates on fungi and wood decay. However, our results indicate that invertebrates influence both the composition of saprotrophic communities in dead wood and their decomposition function, which is vital to forest ecosystems.

Metabarcoding has offered unprecedented insights into microbial diversity. In many studies, short DNA sequences are binned into consecutively lower Linnaean ranks, and ranked groups (e.g., genera) are the units of biodiversity analyses. These analyses assume that Linnaean ranks are biologically meaningful and that identically ranked groups are comparable. We used a metabarcode dataset for marine planktonic diatoms to illustrate the limits of this approach. We found that the 20 most abundant marine planktonic diatom genera ranged in age from 4 to 134 million years, indicating the non-equivalence of genera because some have had more time to diversify than others. However, species richness was largely independent of genus age, suggesting that disparities in species richness among genera were better explained by variation in rates of speciation and extinction. Taxonomic classifications often do not reflect phylogeny, so genus-level analyses can include phylogenetically nested genera, further confounding rank-based analyses. These results underscore the indispensable role of phylogeny in understanding patterns of microbial diversity.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"5800173382","403249","National Science Foundation","0","FALSE","351","12","11","30013161",NA,NA,NA,2018

Here, we characterized microplastics collected in the Bay of Brest by manual sorting followed by Raman spectroscopy and studied their associated bacterial assemblages using 16S amplicon high-throughput sequencing. Our methodology allowed discriminating polymer type (polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene) within small size ranges (0.3–1 vs. 1–2 vs. 2–5 mm) of microplastics collected. Data showed high species richness and diversity on microplastics compared to surrounding seawater samples encompassing both free living and particle attached bacteria. Even though a high proportion of operational taxonomic units (OTU; 94 ± 4%) was shared among all plastic polymers, polystyrene fragments exhibited distinct bacterial assemblages as compared to polyethylene and polypropylene samples. No effect of microplastic size was revealed regardless of polymer type, site and date of collection. The Vibrio genus was commonly detected in the microplastic fraction and specific PCR were performed to determine the presence of potentially pathogenic Vibrio strains (namely V. aestuarianus and the V. splendidus polyphyletic group). V. splendidus related species harboring putative oyster pathogens were detected on most microplastic pools (77%) emphasizing the need of further research to understand the role of microplastics on pathogen population transport and ultimate disease emergence.

Background: Oligonucleotide signatures (signatures) have been widely used for studying microbial diversity and function in wet-lab settings, but using them for accurate in silico identification of organisms from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data is only a proof of concept. Existing signature design programs for sequence signatures (signatures matching exactly one sequence) or clade signatures (signatures matching every sequence in a phylogenetic clade) are not able to identify all possible polymorphic sites for sequences with high similarity and perform poorly when handling large genome sequencing datasets. Results: We introduce cluster signatures: subsequences that match perfectly and exclusively any group of sequences in a data set. Cluster signatures provide complete recall for primer/probe design and increased discrimination between sequences beyond that of clade signatures. Using cluster signatures for in silico identification of HTS targets achieves good precision/recall and running time performance. This method has been implemented into an open source tool, the Automated Oligonucleotide Design Pipeline (adop), included in supplementary material and available at: https://bitbucket.org/wenchen_aafc/aodp_v2.0_release. Conclusions: Cluster signatures provide a rapid and universal analysis tool to identify all possible short diagnostic DNA markers and variants from any DNA sequencing dataset.

In this size range, Bolidophyceae is a group of eukaryotes that contains species with cells surrounded by 5 or 8 silica plates (Parmales) as well as naked flagellated species (formerly Bolidomonadales). Bolidophyceae share a common ancestor with diatoms, one of the most successful groups of phytoplankton. This review summarizes the current information on taxonomy, phylogeny, ecology, and physiology obtained by recent studies using a range of approaches including metabarcoding.

High precision, high coverage DNA-based diet analysis tools allow great insight into the food web interactions of cryptic taxa. We used DNA fecal-metabarcoding to look for unrecorded taxa within the diet of a generalist central-placed predator, the little penguin Eudyptula minor. We examined 208 scats from 106 breeding pairs throughout August-February in a large colony at Phillip Island, Australia. While we confirmed a largely piscivorous diet, we also recovered DNA sequences from gelatinous and crustaceous plankton groups that have not previously been detected in the little penguin diet using other diet analysis methods. Gelatinous plankton, including salps, appendicularians, scyphozoans, and hydrozoans were present in 76% of samples and represented 25% of all sequences. DNA recovered from minute copepods and appendicularians may indicate links between trophic levels through secondary predation. Percentage frequency of occurrence (%FOO) demonstrated that little penguin diet composition changed over months and stages (incubation, guard, and post-guard) of the breeding season (month: <U+03C7> 2 = 201.91, df = NA, p < 0.01; stage: <U+03C7> 2 = 33.221, df = NA, p = 0.015). Relative read abundance (RRA) uncovered variations in the relative abundance of taxa in the diet over months and stages (month: F = 53.18, df = 59, p < 0.001; stage: F = 66.56, df = 29, p < 0.001). The diet became progressively fish-focused over months of the season and stages, while salps were only present in 4 out of 6 months, with a peak in September. Based on their prevalence in this dataset, in this year of very high breeding success (2.15 chicks per pair), salps may constitute a food source for this largely piscivorous generalist.

Rivers are among the most threatened freshwater ecosystems, and anthropogenic activities are affecting both river structures and water quality. While assessing the organisms can provide a comprehensive measure of a river's ecological status, it is limited by the traditional morphotaxonomy-based biomonitoring. Recent advances in environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding allow to identify prokaryotes and eukaryotes in one sequencing run, and could thus allow unprecedented resolution. Whether such eDNA-based data can be used directly to predict the pollution status of rivers as a complementation of environmental data remains unknown. Here we used eDNA metabarcoding to explore the main stressors of rivers along which community structure changes, and to identify the method's potential for predicting pollution status based on eDNA data. We showed that a broad range of taxa in bacterial, protistan, and metazoan communities could be profiled with eDNA. Nutrients were the main driving stressor affecting communities' structure, alpha diversity, and the ecological network. We specifically observed that the relative abundance of indicative OTUs was significantly correlated with nutrient levels. These OTUs data could be used to predict the nutrient status up to 79% accuracy on testing data sets. Thus, our study gives a novel approach to predicting the pollution status of rivers by eDNA data.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"21537","2017ZX07602-002","Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment","0","FALSE","357","52","20","30211550",NA,NA,NA,2018

Communities of microscopic dinoflagellates are omnipresent in aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, their traits drive community processes with profound effects on global biogeochemistry. Species traits are, however, not necessarily static but respond to environmental changes in order to maintain fitness and may differ with cell size that scales physiological rates. Comprehending such trait characteristics is necessary for a mechanistic understanding of plankton community dynamics and resulting biogeochemical impacts. Here, we used information theory to analyze metatranscriptomes of micro- and nano-dinoflagellate communities in three ecosystems. Measures of gene expression variations were set as a proxy to determine conserved and plastic community traits and the environmental influence on trait changes. Using metabarcoding, we further investigated if communities with a more similar taxon composition also express more similar traits. Our results indicate that plastic community traits mainly arise from membrane vesicle associated processes in all the environments we investigated. A specific environmental influence on trait plasticity was observed to arise from nitrogen availability in both size classes. Species interactions also appeared to be responsible for trait plasticity in the smaller-sized dinoflagellates. Additionally, the smaller-sized dinoflagellate communities are characterized by the expression of a large pool of habitat specific genes despite being taxonomically more similar across the habitats, in contrast to the microplanktonic assemblages that adapted to their environments by changing species composition. Our data highlight the functional diversification on the gene level as a signature of smaller sized dinoflagellates, nitrogen availability and species interactions as drivers of trait plasticity, and traits most likely linked to fitness and community performance.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Adaptation | Dinoflagellates | Metabarcoding | Metatranscriptomics | Molecular ecology | Plankton","21100790929","EF-0629624","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","1","TRUE","358","5","OCT",NA,"358","DFG",NA,2018

There is an increasing interest in the Eustigmatophyceae, a class of stramenopile microalgae, because they offer a variety of high-value health-beneficial compounds, e.g. polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), while concomitantly producing high biomass. Clarification of the taxonomy of these organisms at the species level is important in order to achieve reproducible results and constant yields of valuable compounds in their exploitation. Here the distinction of the, so far exclusively, morphologically defined species of the genera Eustigmatos and Vischeria was tested. Distinctions inferred from almost full 18S and ITS2 rRNA as well as plastid-encoded rbcL gene sequences were evaluated following a morphological investigation. The ITS2 secondary-structure-based phylogenies separated independent lineages (species) with long internal branches. This recommends ITS2 as a promising marker for a DNA metabarcoding approach (culture-independent biodiversity assessment). In contrast, the 18S V4 region which is commonly used in metabarcoding was almost invariant, whereas the almost full length sequences distinguished eight groups/types of strains. Monophyly of the species was supported by shared ITS2 secondary structure features, making them distinct from other eustigmatophyte lineages in concordance with phylogenetic analyses. No groups of strains were congruently supported by all three markers. Consequently, the previous distinction of two genera on the basis of morphology cannot be retained and the species should be accommodated in a single genus, Vischeria. Taxonomic changes among the species with the definition of epitypes, on the basis of cryopreserved strains, are recommended. Two findings point to a more complex evolutionary history of the species. The rbcL and nuclear markers resulted in disparate groupings of strains. In three species divergent intragenomic ITS2 paralogues were revealed. Therefore, a still broader taxon sampling, in conjunction with a deep sequencing approach, is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the complex evolution of eustigmatophyte species.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Eustigmatophyceae | Eustigmatos | fatty acids | internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) | secondary structure | taxonomy | Vischeria","18021","613303","European Commission","0","FALSE","359","53","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

We argue that (a) the extensive coverage of reference sequence databases for COI; (b) the variation it presents; (c) the comparative advantages for denoising protein-coding genes; and (d) recent advances in DNA sequencing protocols argue in favour of standardizing for the use of COI for metazoan community samples.

Here we used three approaches to profile soil arthropod communities at the family level of resolution across 10 distinct sites via morphological identification, metabarcoding of DNA from the extracted arthropods, and metabarcoding directly from bulk soils. Although the three methods differed to some degree in their ability to detect some individual taxa, we found that all three methods yielded well-correlated site-level estimates of diversity (Spearman's <U+03C1> = 0.63 with P < 0.05 for all correlations) and overall arthropod community composition (Mantel <U+03C1> = 0.45 with P < 0.05).

The bioassessment of aquatic ecosystems is currently based on various biotic indices that use the occurrence and/or abundance of selected taxonomic groups to define ecological status. These conventional indices have some limitations, often related to difficulties in morphological identification of bioindicator taxa. Recent development of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding could potentially alleviate some of these limitations, by using DNA sequences instead of morphology to identify organisms and to characterize a given ecosystem. In this paper, we review the structure of conventional biotic indices, and we present the results of pilot metabarcoding studies using environmental DNA to infer biotic indices. We discuss the main advantages and pitfalls of metabarcoding approaches to assess parameters such as richness, abundance, taxonomic composition and species ecological values, to be used for calculation of biotic indices. We present some future developments to fully exploit the potential of metabarcoding data and improve the accuracy and precision of their analysis. We also propose some recommendations for the future integration of DNA metabarcoding to routine biomonitoring programs.","17","Journal","re","Review","100","33","Bioassessment | Biomonitoring | Environmental DNA | Freshwater | Marine | Metabarcording","25349","668981","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","1","TRUE","363","637-638",NA,"29801222",NA,NA,"S0048969718316322",2018

Unfortunately, the diet of males and females can be difficult to describe, particularly when they are marine predators. We combined two molecular techniques to describe haul-out use and prey preferences of male and female harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) from Comox and Cowichan Bay (Canada) during 2012–2013. DNA metabarcoding quantified the diet proportions comprised of prey species in harbor seal scat, and qPCR determined the sex of the individual that deposited each scat. Using 287 female and 260 male samples, we compared the monthly sex ratio with GLMs and analyzed prey consumption relative to sex, season, site, and year with PERMANOVA. The sex ratio between monthly samples differed widely in both years (range = 12%–79% males) and showed different patterns at each haul-out site. Male and female diet differed across both years and sites: Females consumed a high proportion of demersal fish species while males consumed more salmonid species. Diet composition was related to both sex and season (PERMANOVA: R2 = 27%, p < 0.001; R2 = 24%, p < 0.001, respectively) and their interaction (PERMANOVA: R2 = 11%, p < 0.001). Diet differences between males and females were consistent across site and year, suggesting fundamental foraging differences, including that males may have a larger impact on salmonids than females. Our novel combination of techniques allowed for both prey taxonomic and spatiotemporal resolution unprecedented in marine predators.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","diet analysis | DNA metabarcoding | marine mammals | predator prey interactions | sex identification","21100264002","undefined","Western Washington University","1","TRUE","364","8","19",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

We performed metabarcoding of the total and active fungal communities and measured extracellular enzyme activity in leaf litter after it decomposed for approximately two years in a long-term simulated N deposition experiment. We found that N fertilization decreased the relative abundance of six species in the active community that were highly correlated with lignin decomposing enzyme activity. Four of these species have currently unknown taxonomic identity and should be targets for isolation and further characterization. Nitrogen fertilization also increased species richness and relative abundance of yeasts in the total community and decreased their relative activity levels, suggesting these species may be dormant or otherwise inactive.

Yellow Tang, Zebrasoma flavescens, are a popular species in the aquarium industry. Currently, all Yellow Tang are collected from wild stocks, with collection in Hawaii accounting for the bulk of the individuals found in the trade. Although culture of this species has recently been successful, survival remains low and mass mortality events, particularly associated with the transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding, continue to be observed. Improving survival and gaining a more thorough understanding of the drivers behind early prey selection, such as mouth gape and osteological development, are of primary importance in advancing the culture of Yellow Tang. For the present study, a supplemental size-sorted mixture of wild zooplankton was offered in conjunction with and compared to the cultured nauplii of Parvocalanus crassirostris to determine the effect on survival. Prey selection was determined via metabarcoding. Osteological development was documented and mouth gape measured from 1 to 6 days post hatch to better determine appropriate prey types and size ranges. Survival was significantly lower in larvae fed cultured nauplii supplemented with wild zooplankton, 6.9% v. 18.5%. Regardless of the presence of wild zooplankton, larvae preferentially selected for P. crassirostris based on molecular determination of prey consumption. However, it is likely that protozoans were mostly excluded from this molecular analysis possibly due to the type of primer selected. Mouth gape height increased by approximately 100 µm and mouth gape width by approximately 55 µm, during the study period. Although no significant difference in growth was calculated between treatments, larvae receiving the wild zooplankton supplement diet were observed to grow at a slightly slower rate than larvae being fed only cultured copepod nauplii. The rate at which the mouth gape increased suggests that the currently cultured and utilized copepod nauplii may not be an optimally sized prey item shortly after first feed. These findings indicate that first feeding Yellow Tang larvae are capable of consuming larger prey at an earlier age than they have been offered in previous rearing attempts, but that the larvae may continue to benefit from the presence of less elusive prey items, such as ciliates or rotifers, due to their delayed osteological development. Osteological development was slow with very little ossification occurring by 6 days post hatch and only in those larvae fed solely cultured nauplii. However, their selection of copepod nauplii suggests that some aspect of this prey item is preferential to the first feeding larvae and may elicit a hunting response essential to initiating exogenous feeding.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","Metabarcoding | Mouth gape | Osteological development | Prey selectivity | Yellow Tang | Zebrasoma flavescens","29419","undefined","SeaWorld and Busch Gardens Conservation Fund","0","FALSE","367","495",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0044848618301078",2018

Hatchery environment, which greatly differs from the natural environment, is identified as the main driver of the phenotypic mismatch between captive and wild parrs. The latter is also suspected to impact the gut microbiota composition, which can be associated with essential metabolic functions for their host. We hypothesized that hatchery-raised parrs potentially recruit gut microbial communities that are different from those recruited in the wild. This study evaluated the impacts of artificial rearing on gut microbiota composition in 0+ parrs meant for stocking in two distinct Canadian rivers: Rimouski and Malbaie (Quebec, Canada). Striking differences between hatchery and wild-born parrs’ gut microbiota suggest that microbiota could be another factor that could impact their survival in the targeted river, because the microbiome is narrowly related to host physiology. For instance, major commensals belonging to Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridiacea from wild parrs’ gut microbiota were substituted in captive parrs by lactic acid bacteria from the Lactobacillaceae family. Overall, captive parrs host a generalist bacterial community whereas wild parrs’ microbiota is much more specialized. This is the very first study demonstrating extensive impact of captive rearing on intestinal microbiota composition in Atlantic salmon intended for wild population stocking. Our results strongly suggest the need to implement microbial ecology concepts into conservation management of endangered salmon stocks supplemented with hatchery-reared parrs.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","16S SSU rRNA gene | aquaculture | Atlantic salmon | host–microbiota interactions | metabarcoding sequencing | microbial ecology | stocking","19400157205","undefined","H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions","1","TRUE","368","11","9",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Research on captive mammalian models has revealed tight mutual interactions between immune functions and GM. However, our knowledge of GM versus immune system interactions in wild populations and nonmammalian species remains poor. Here, we focus on the association between GM community structure and immune response measured via the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) skin swelling test in 12-day-old nestlings of a passerine bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). The PHA test, a widely used method in field ecoimmunology, assesses cell-mediated immunity. GM structure was inferred based on high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of microbial communities in fecal samples. We did not find any association between PHA response and GM diversity; however, our data revealed that the intensity of PHA response was correlated with differences in GM composition at the whole-community level. Ten bacterial operational taxonomic units corresponding to both putative commensal and pathogens were identified as drivers of the compositional variation. In conclusion, our study suggests existence of GM versus immune system interactions in a free-living nonmammalian species, which corresponds with previous research on captive vertebrates.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","fitness | immunity | inflammation | metabarcoding | microbiome | symbiosis","21100264002","260 434/2018","Grantová Agentura Ceské Republiky","1","TRUE","369","8","19",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Indeed, knowledge concerning biological interactions of microbes and meiofauna in marine extreme environments is scarce, especially for nematodes. In this study, we used microscopic observations [fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)] and metabarcoding of 16S rRNA to characterize the bacterial community of the nematode species Oncholaimus dyvae, an overlooked but ecologically important vent organism. Detection of bacteria in the buccal cavity and on the cuticle (SEM) and epibionts in its intestine (FISH) suggests that O. Dyvae harbors its own bacterial community. Molecular results and phylogenetic analysis show that bacteria associated with this species are related to symbiotic lineages typical of hydrothermal vent fauna, such as sulfur-oxidizing bacteria related to Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. This multi-approach study suggests a potential symbiotic role of bacteria with its nematode host and opens new research perspectives on vent meiofauna.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Endosymbiont | Lucky Strike vent field | Meiofauna | Nematode | Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria","21100226442","2013–2015","Pioneer Hi-Bred","1","TRUE","370","9","SEP",NA,"2246",NA,NA,2018

To enable successful management of marine bioinvasions, timely and robust scientific advice is required. This knowledge should inform managers and stakeholders on the magnitude of a pressure (rate of human-mediated introductions), the environmental state of an ecosystem (impacts of non-indigenous species), and the success of management response (prevention, eradication, mitigation). This advice often relies on baseline biodiversity information in the form of measureable parameters (metrics). This can be derived from conventional approaches such as visual surveys, but also by utilizing environmental DNA/RNA-based molecular techniques, which are increasingly being touted as promising tools for assessing biodiversity and detecting rare or invasive species. Depending on the stage of incursion, each approach has merits and limitations. In this review we assess the performance of biosecurity-relevant biodiversity parameters derived from eDNA/eRNA samples and discuss the results in relation to different stages of invasion and management applications. The overall performance of considered methods ranged between 42 and 90% based on defined criteria, with target-specific approaches scoring higher for respective biosecurity applications, followed by eDNA metabarcoding. Caveats are discussed along with avenues which may enhance these techniques and their successful uptake for marine biosecurity surveillance and management. To facilitate and encourage uptake of these techniques, there is a need for an international collaborative framework aimed at unifying molecular sampling and analysis methodologies. Improvement of quantitative capacity and cost-efficiency will also enhance their integration in biosecurity programmes.","2","Journal","re","Review","100","5","Early detection | ERNA | Metabarcoding | Non-indigenous species | Species-specific assays","21100790929","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","371","5","SEP",NA,"322",NA,NA,2018

Meiobenthic organisms, consisting of meiofauna and benthic microeukaryotes, are key components of marine ecosystems and facilitate bentho-pelagic coupling. However, their bio-geographic ranges and dispersal abilities are poorly known, especially in Antarctic waters where knowledge is extremely limited. Many Antarctic marine invertebrates are reported to have circumpolar distributions despite lecithotrophy and brooding development being common. Similarly, most meiofauna have developmental stages that are often assumed to have limited dispersal capabilities. To assess Antarctic meiobenthic community distribution patterns and diversity, the hypervariable V9 region of the 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene was used to metabarcode shelf sediment samples (water depth 223 to 820 m) across a 5500 km region of the Western Antarctic. We found that some taxa had broad geographic distributions given that 28 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were present in every core processed, 74 OTUs were found at every sampling event, and 722 OTUs were present in all of the major water basins sampled. Among these broadly distributed OTUs, metazoan taxa from 4 phyla (annelids, arthropods, kinorhynchs, and nematodes) were dominant members. As many of these OTUs relate to taxa expected to have limited dispersal capabilities based on current life history information, these results highlight our limited understanding of how small organisms move around in the sea. We also noted that the Antarctic Peninsula hosts a strikingly different and less diverse community than higher latitude regions, in contrast to benthic macrofauna.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","18S rRNA | Antarctic sediment | Illumina | Meiobenthos | Meiofauna | Metabarcoding | Stramenopiles","12169","ANT-1043670",NA,"0","FALSE","372","603",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Building DNA barcode databases for plants has historically been ad hoc, and often with a relatively narrow taxonomic focus. To realize the full potential of DNA barcoding for plants, and particularly its application to metabarcoding for mixed-species environmental samples, systematic sequencing of reference collections is required using an augmented set of DNA barcode loci, applied according to agreed data generation and analysis standards. The largest and most complete reference collections of plants are held in herbaria. Australia has a globally significant flora that is well sampled and expertly curated by its herbaria, coordinated through the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria. There exists a tremendous opportunity to provide a comprehensive and taxonomically robust reference database for plant DNA barcoding applications by undertaking coordinated and systematic sequencing of the entire flora of Australia utilizing existing herbarium material. In this paper, we review the development of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding and consider the requirements for a robust and comprehensive system. We analyzed the current availability of DNA barcode reference data for Australian plants, recommend priority taxa for database inclusion, and highlight future applications of a comprehensive metabarcoding system.

To evaluate the potential effect of the application of different bioinformatics workflow on the results, we compared the performance of different analysis platforms on two contrasting high-throughput sequencing data sets. Our analysis revealed that the computation time, quality of error filtering and hence output of specific bioinformatics process largely depends on the platform used. Our results show that none of the bioinformatics workflows appears to perfectly filter out the accumulated errors and generate Operational Taxonomic Units, although PipeCraft, LotuS and PIPITS perform better than QIIME2 and Galaxy for the tested fungal amplicon dataset.

Temporal shifts in fecal microbiota structure and stability were observed across the immediate postweaning period (P < 0.05), including significant shifts in the relative levels of specific bacterial phylotypes (P < 0.05). ETEC exposure did not change the fecal microbiota structure (P > 0.05), but significant variations in fecal community structure and stability were linked to variations in ETEC excretion level at particular time points (P < 0.05). In this study, marked temporal changes in microbiota structure and stability were evident over the short weaning transition period, with a relationship between ETEC excretion level and fecal microbiota composition being observed.

Small mesopelagic fish are ubiquitous in the ocean, representing an important trophic link between zooplankton and tertiary consumers such as larger fish, marine mammals and birds. Lanternfishes (Myctophidae) are common worldwide as well as in the Southern Ocean. However, only 17 of the approximately 250 myctophid species occur exclusively in sub-Antarctic or Antarctic waters. It is unclear whether they colonized these latitudes once and diversified from there, or whether multiple colonization events took place in which multiple ancestral phenotypes entered the Southern Ocean at various times. Phylogeographic patterns have been investigated for individual myctophid species, but so far no study has compared species across the Southern Ocean. Here, we present a dataset with previously unpublished cytochrome c oxidase I (COI; n = 299) and rhodopsin (rh1; n = 87) gene sequences from specimens collected at various locations in the Southern Ocean. Our data extend the DNA barcode library of Antarctic mesopelagic fish substantially. Combined morphological and molecular taxonomy lead to confident species level identification in 271 out of 299 cases, providing a robust reference dataset for specimen identification, independently of incomplete morphological characters. This is highly topical in light of prospective ecological metabarcoding studies. Unambiguous sequences were subsequently combined with publicly available sequences of the global DNA barcode library yielding a dataset of over 1,000 individuals for phylogenetic and phylogeographic inference. Maximum likelihood trees were compared with results of recent studies and with the geographical origin of the samples. As expected for these markers, deep phylogenetic relationships remain partially unclear. However, COI offers unmatched sample and taxon coverage and our results at the subfamily to genus level concur to a large extent with other studies. Southern Ocean myctophids are from at least three distant subfamilies suggesting that colonization has occurred repeatedly. Overall, spatial divergence of myctophids is rare, potentially due to their enormous abundance and the homogenizing force of ocean currents. However, we recommend further investigation of the phylogenetic position of Symbolophorus boops and highlight potential (pseudo-)cryptic or unrecognized species in Gymnoscopelus bolini, Lampanyctus achirus, and the non-myctophid genus Bathylagus.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Adaptation | Antarctic | COI | Marine biodiversity | Myctophidae | Phylogeny | Rhodopsin","21100834704","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","377","6","SEP",NA,"120",NA,NA,2018

Ballast water remains a potent vector of non-native aquatic species introductions, despite increased global efforts to reduce risk of ballast water mediated invasions. This is particularly true of intracoastal vessel traffic, whose characteristics may limit the feasibility and efficacy of management through ballast water exchange (BWE). Here we utilize high throughput sequencing (HTS) to assess biological communities associated with ballast water being delivered to Valdez, Alaska from multiple source ports along the Pacific Coast of the United States. Our analyses indicate that BWE has a significant but modest effect on ballast water assemblages. Although overall richness was not reduced with exchange, we detected losses of some common benthic coastal taxa (e.g., decapods, mollusks, bryozoans, cnidaria) and gains of open ocean taxa (e.g., certain copepods, diatoms, and dinoflagellates), including some potentially toxic species. HTS-based metabarcoding identified significantly differentiated biodiversity signatures from individual source ports; this signal persisted, though weakened, in vessels undergoing BWE, indicating incomplete faunal turnover associated with management. Our analysis also enabled identification of taxa that may be of particular concern if established in Alaskan waters.

Feather mites are among the most common and diverse ectosymbionts of birds, yet basic questions such as the nature of their relationship remain largely unanswered. One reason for feather mites being understudied is that their morphological identification is often virtually impossible when using female or young individuals. Even for adult male specimens this task is tedious and requires advanced taxonomic expertise, thus hampering large-scale studies. In addition, molecular-based methods are challenging because the low DNA amounts usually obtained from these tiny mites do not reach the levels required for high-throughput sequencing. This work aims to overcome these issues by using a DNA metabarcoding approach to accurately identify and quantify the feather mite species present in a sample. DNA metabarcoding is a widely used molecular technique that takes advantage of high-throughput sequencing methodologies to assign the taxonomic identity to all the organisms present in a complex sample (i.e., a sample made up of multiple specimens that are hard or impossible to individualise). We present a high-throughput method for feather mite identification using a fragment of the COI gene as marker and Illumina Miseq technology. We tested this method by performing two experiments plus a field test over a total of 11,861 individual mites (5360 of which were also morphologically identified). In the first experiment, we tested the probability of detecting a single feather mite in a heterogeneous pool of non-conspecific individuals. In the second experiment, we made 2 × 2 combinations of species and studied the relationship between the proportion of individuals of a given species in a sample and the proportion of sequences retrieved to test whether DNA metabarcoding can reliably quantify the relative abundance of mites in a sample. Here we also tested the efficacy of degenerate primers (i.e., a mixture of similar primers that differ in one or several bases that are designed to increase the chance of annealing) and investigated the relationship between the number of mismatches and PCR success. Finally, we applied our DNA metabarcoding pipeline to a total of 6501 unidentified and unsorted feather mite individuals sampled from 380 European passerine birds belonging to 10 bird species (field test). Our results show that this proposed pipeline is suitable for correct identification and quantitative estimation of the relative abundance of feather mite species in complex samples, especially when dealing with a moderate number (> 30) of individuals per sample.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","DNA metabarcoding | Experimental pipeline | Feather mites | High-throughput sequencing | Molecular identification","21504","RFBR-6-04-00486","<U+0420><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+0439><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0424><U+043E><U+043D><U+0434> <U+0424><U+0443><U+043D><U+0434><U+0430><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+044B><U+0445> <U+0418><U+0441><U+0441><U+043B><U+0435><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439> (<U+0420><U+0424><U+0424><U+0418>)","0","FALSE","380","76","1","30178174",NA,NA,NA,2018

Molecular methods, such as metabarcoding, have the potential to rapidly expand our knowledge of biodiversity, supporting assessment, management, and conservation. In the marine environment, where hard substrata are more difficult to access than soft bottoms for quantitative ecological studies, Artificial Substrate Units (ASUs) allow for standardized sampling. We deployed ASUs within five regional seas (Baltic Sea, Northeast Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, and Red Sea) for 12–26 months to measure the diversity and community composition of macroinvertebrates. We identified invertebrates using a traditional approach based on morphological characters, and by metabarcoding of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. We compared community composition and diversity metrics obtained using the two methods. Diversity was significantly correlated between data types. Metabarcoding of ASUs allowed for robust comparisons of community composition and diversity, but not all groups were successfully sequenced. All locations were significantly different in taxonomic composition as measured with both kinds of data. We recovered previously known regional biogeographical patterns in both datasets (e.g., low species diversity in the Black and Baltic Seas, affinity between the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean). We conclude that the two approaches provide complementary information and that metabarcoding shows great promise for marine monitoring. However, until its pitfalls are addressed, the use of metabarcoding in monitoring of rocky benthic assemblages should be used in addition to classical approaches rather than instead of them.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","15","Artificial Substrate Unit (ASU) | COI | innovative monitoring | marine invertebrates | metabarcoding","21100264002","308392","European Commission","1","TRUE","381","8","17",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. High-throughput sequencing of environmental DNA (i.e., eDNA metabarcoding) has become an increasingly popular method for monitoring aquatic biodiversity. At present, such analyses require target-specific primers to amplify DNA barcodes from co-occurring species, and this initial amplification can introduce biases. Understanding the performance of different primers is thus recommended prior to undertaking any metabarcoding initiative. While multiple software programs are available to evaluate metabarcoding primers, all programs have their own strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, a robust in silico workflow for the evaluation of metabarcoding primers will benefit from the use of multiple programs. Furthermore, geographic differences in species biodiversity are likely to influence the performance of metabarcoding primers and further complicate the evaluation process. Here, an in silico workflow is presented that can be used to evaluate the performance of metabarcoding primers on an ecoregion scale. This workflow was used to evaluate the performance of published and newly developed eDNA metabarcoding primers for the freshwater fish biodiversity of the Murray–Darling Basin (Australia). To validate the in silico workflow, a subset of the primers, including one newly designed primer pair, were used in metabarcoding analyses of an artificial DNA community and eDNA samples. The results show that the in silico workflow allows for a robust evaluation of metabarcoding primers and can reveal important trade-offs that need to be considered when selecting the most suitable primer. Additionally, a new primer pair was described and validated that allows for more robust taxonomic assignments and is less influenced by primer biases compared to commonly used fish metabarcoding primers.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","environmental DNA | high-throughput sequencing | in silico | metabarcoding | primers","21100264002","164","Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment","1","TRUE","382","8","17",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Metabarcoding approaches simultaneously amplify a short, variable genomic region, or “barcode,” from a broad taxonomic group via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using universal primers that anneal to flanking conserved regions. Results of these experiments are reported as occurrence data, which provide a list of taxa amplified from the sample, or relative abundance data, which measure the relative contribution of each taxon to the overall composition of amplified product. The accuracy of both occurrence and relative abundance estimates can be affected by a variety of biological and technical biases. For example, taxa with larger biomass may be better represented in environmental samples than those with smaller biomass. Here, we explore how polymerase choice, a potential source of technical bias, might influence results in metabarcoding experiments. We compared potential biases of six commercially available polymerases using a combination of mixtures of amplifiable synthetic sequences and real sedimentary DNA extracts. We find that polymerase choice can affect both occurrence and relative abundance estimates and that the main source of this bias appears to be polymerase preference for sequences with specific GC contents.

By using this sequence as probe we successfully facilitated the simultaneous identification of fish larvae belonging to the order Siluriformes and to the Characiformes represented in our ichthyoplankton samples.

C. bacchus is traditionally considered to specialise on the dung of large herbivores for both larval and adult feeding. We successfully extracted mammal DNA from 151 adult C. bacchus fecal samples, representing 16 mammal species (ranging from elephants to small rodents), many of which are hitherto undescribed in the diet. Adult C. bacchus showed clear dung source preferences, especially for large herbivores inhabiting dense-cover vegetation. Our approach also confirmed the presence of cryptic taxa in the study area, and we propose that this may be used for biodiversity survey and monitoring purposes. Murid rodent feces were the most commonly fed-upon dung source (77.5%) for adult C. bacchus, differing markedly from the large and megaherbivore dung sources used for larval rearing. These findings support the hypothesis of life history-specific shifts in resource use in dung beetles, and reveal a hitherto unsuspected, but ecologically important, role of these dung beetles in consuming rodent feces. The differences in feeding abilities of the larval and adult life history stages have profound consequences for their resource use and foraging strategies, and hence the ecological role of dung beetles.

Our results showed that different filters (with the exception of 20-µm large-pore filters) were broadly consistent in their DNA capture ability. The 0.45-µm filters performed the best in terms of total DNA yield, probability of species detection, repeatability within pond and consistency between ponds. However performance of 0.45-µm filters was only marginally better than for 0.8-µm filters, while filtration time was significantly longer. Given this trade-off, the 0.8-µm filter is the optimal pore size of membrane filter for turbid, eutrophic and high fish density ponds analysed here. The 0.45-µm Sterivex enclosed filters performed reasonably well and are suitable in situations where on-site filtration is required. Finally, prefilters are applied only if absolutely essential for reducing the filtration time or increasing the throughput volume of the capture filters. In summary, we found encouraging similarity in the results obtained from different filtration methods, but the optimal pore size of filter or filter type might strongly depend on the water type under study.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","eDNA method development | fish monitoring | lentic systems | prefiltration","11700154306","undefined","China Scholarship Council","0","FALSE","390","18","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Molecular Ecology Resources Published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Metabarcoding diet analysis has become a valuable tool in animal ecology; however, co-amplified predator sequences are not generally used for anything other than to validate predator identity. Exemplified by the common vampire bat, we demonstrate the use of metabarcoding to infer predator population structure alongside diet assessments. Growing populations of common vampire bats impact human, livestock and wildlife health in Latin America through transmission of pathogens, such as lethal rabies viruses. Techniques to determine large-scale variation in vampire bat diet and bat population structure would empower locality- and species-specific projections of disease transmission risks. However, previously used methods are not cost-effective and efficient for large-scale applications. Using bloodmeal and faecal samples from common vampire bats from coastal, Andean and Amazonian regions of Peru, we showcase metabarcoding as a scalable tool to assess vampire bat population structure and feeding preferences. Dietary metabarcoding was highly effective, detecting vertebrate prey in 93.2% of the samples. Bats predominantly preyed on domestic animals, but fed on tapirs at one Amazonian site. In addition, we identified arthropods in 9.3% of samples, likely reflecting consumption of ectoparasites. Using the same data, we document mitochondrial geographic population structure in the common vampire bat in Peru. Such simultaneous inference of vampire bat diet and population structure can enable new insights into the interplay between vampire bat ecology and disease transmission risks. Importantly, the methodology can be incorporated into metabarcoding diet studies of other animals to couple information on diet and population structure.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","diet analyses | ecological genetics | environmental DNA | mammals | predator–prey interactions | wildlife management","11700154306","NSF-DEB-1020966","National Science Foundation","1","TRUE","391","18","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

This represents a critical knowledge gap, as methodologically sound field sampling is the foundation for subsequent analyses. We reviewed field sampling methods used for metabarcoding studies of both terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem biodiversity over a nearly three-year period (n = 75).

It would be possible for researchers to replicate only 5% of the metabarcoding studies in our sample, a poorer level of reproducibility than for ecological studies in general. Our findings suggest greater attention to field sampling methods, and reporting is necessary in eDNA-based studies of biodiversity to ensure robust outcomes and future reproducibility.

Species richness is unrivalled as the most reported biodiversity metric in ecological and conservation research. Unfortunately, species richness ignores the scale-dependency of biodiversity.2. We propose the metric uniquity, a quantitative and spatially scalable measure of uniqueness of a site based on a species-by-site matrix and a site-by-habitat type classification with area weights for habitat types correcting for sampling biases.3. An example of uniquity is presented using vascular plant data from 130 sites representing a larger region (Denmark). We demonstrate the importance of the scale parameter of uniquity for the prediction of independent uniqueness indices calculated from species distribution data and the number of recorded red listed species.4. We compare the performance of uniquity with the performance of the indices Local Contribution to Beta Diversity (LCBD) and Range Rarity Richness (RRR), and we investigate its sensitivity to small sample size and poorly resolved habitat classification.5. We assess the performance of the uniquity metric applied to DNA metabarcoding data for plants, fungi and eukaryotes from the same set of study sites.6. Uniquity is a strong predictor of site uniqueness based on national distribution data and also correlates neatly with the observed number of red listed species. Uniquity based on DNA metabarcoding corresponds well with the number of red listed species observed.7. Perspective: Uniquity is generally applicable to biotas sampled with comparable effort, including field inventories, trap sampling, and DNA metabarcoding data. To our knowledge uniquity is the first index of uniqueness that explicitly considers spatial scale and sampling biases, while simultaneously accepting non-annotated DNA-data as input. Based on our study we offer general recommendations for further use and testing of uniquity as conservation value metric.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Biodiversity conservation | eDNA | Metabarcoding | Rarity | Red listed species | Vascular plants","17244","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","393","225",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0006320717318293",2018

Due to primer bias, the ability of metabarcoding to accurately depict biomass of different taxa from bulk communities remains unclear, while PCR-free whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequencing may provide a more reliable alternative. Here, we used a set of documented mock communities comprising 13 species of freshwater macroinvertebrates of estimated individual biomass, to compare the detection efficiency of COI metabarcoding (three different amplicons) and shotgun mitogenome sequencing. Additionally, we used individual COI barcoding and de novo mitochondrial genome sequencing, to provide reference sequences for OTU assignment and metagenome mapping (mitogenome skimming), respectively. We found that, even though both methods occasionally failed to recover very low abundance species, metabarcoding was less consistent, by failing to recover some species with higher abundances, probably due to primer bias. Shotgun sequencing results provided highly significant correlations between read number and biomass in all but one species. Conversely, the read–biomass relationships obtained from metabarcoding varied across amplicons. Specifically, we found significant relationships for eight of 13 (amplicons B1FR-450 bp, FF130R-130 bp) or four of 13 (amplicon FFFR, 658 bp) species. Combining the results of all three COI amplicons (multiamplicon approach) improved the read–biomass correlations for some of the species. Overall, mitogenomic sequencing yielded more informative predictions of biomass content from bulk macroinvertebrate communities than metabarcoding.

In this study, we explore the extent to which ordination results are affected by variation in parameter settings for the clustering procedure.

The 63 data sets thus obtained were subjected to parallel DCA and GNMDS ordinations. The resulting community structures were highly similar across all clustering thresholds. We explain this pattern by the existence of strong ecological structuring gradients and phylogenetically diverse sets of abundant OTUs that are highly stable across clustering thresholds. Removing low-abundance, rare OTUs had negligible effects on community patterns. Our results indicate that microbial data sets with a clear gradient structure are highly robust to choice of sequence clustering threshold.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","bacteria | clustering threshold | community ecology | DNA metabarcoding | fungi | microbial ecology","11700154306","undefined","Oslo University College","0","FALSE","395","18","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Developing efficient, reliable, cost-effective ways to identify diet is required to understand trophic ecology in complex ecosystems and improve food web models. A combination of techniques, each varying in their ability to provide robust, spatially and temporally explicit information can be applied to clarify diet data for ecological research. This study applied an integrative analysis of a fishery-targeted species group—Plectropomus spp. in the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia, by comparing three diet-identification approaches. Visual stomach content analysis provided poor identification with ~14% of stomachs sampled resulting in identification to family or lower. A molecular approach was successful with prey from ~80% of stomachs identified to genus or species, often with several unique prey in a stomach. Stable isotope mixing models utilizing experimentally derived assimilation data, identified similar prey as the molecular technique but at broader temporal scales, particularly when prior diet information was incorporated. Overall, Caesionidae and Pomacentridae were the most abundant prey families (>50% prey contribution) for all Plectropomus spp., highlighting the importance of planktivorous prey. Less abundant prey categories differed among species/color phases indicating possible niche segregation. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the extent of taxonomic resolution provided by molecular techniques, and, like other studies, illustrates that temporal investigations of dietary patterns are more accessible in combination with stable isotopes. The consumption of mainly planktivorous prey within this species group has important implications within coral reef food webs and provides cautionary information regarding the effects that changing resources could have in reef ecosystems.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","coral reef | coral trout | diet | fisheries | metabarcoding | next-generation sequencing | Plectropomus | stable isotopes | stomach contents","21100264002","144482","Australian Coral Reef Society","1","TRUE","397","8","18",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

In addition to the classical techniques (e.g., physicochemical analysis, microscopy, chromatography, immunoassay, DNA metabarcoding, spectroscopy), electrochemical based-sensor devices have arisen as reliable and green techniques for food analysis including honey evaluation, allowing in-situ and on-line assessment, being a user-friendly procedure not requiring high technical expertise.

To get insights into associations between the two highly diverse groups, we studied composition and potential function of mite-associated fungal communities occurring in soil. Two different mite species living in temperate region pine forest soil were screened for associated fungi. The fungal community was assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses in a predatory (Leptogamasus obesus) and a predominantly saprobic (Oppiella subpectinata) mite species as well as in the organic soil layer. Key fungi were identified by sequencing, and community composition was exemplarily compared between the RFLP and a 454 metabarcoding approach. Composition of the fungal communities differed between mite species and between mites and organic soil layer. The mites were predominantly associated with Zygomycota, less frequently with Ascomycota, and rarely with Basidiomycota. The bulk soil was colonized by roughly equal proportions of the three phyla. Fungal taxa being known to exhibit chitinolytic activity were predominantly restricted to mites. Compositional and functional differences between the communities suggest that mites represent a particular microhabitat for fungi, the “acarosphere.” This mobile habitat may contribute to nutrient cycling by combining fungal and animal decomposition activities and serve as vector for soil-inhabiting fungi.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","Fungi | ITS rRNA gene | Leptogamasus obesus | Micro-compartment | Mites | Oppiella subpectinata","5400152649","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","399","17","9",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Previous observations suggested that microbial communities contribute to coral health and the ecological resilience of coral reefs. However, most studies of coral microbiology focused on prokaryotes and the endosymbiotic algae Symbiodinium. In contrast, knowledge concerning diversity of other protists is still lacking, possibly due to methodological constraints. As most eukaryotic DNA in coral samples was derived from hosts, protist diversity was missed in metagenome analyses. To tackle this issue, we designed blocking primers for Scleractinia sequences amplified with two primer sets that targeted variable loops of the 18S rRNA gene (18SV1V2 and 18SV4). These blocking primers were used on environmental colonies of Pocillopora damicornis sensu lato from two regions with contrasting thermal regimes (Djibouti and New Caledonia). In addition to Symbiodinium clades A/C/D, Licnophora and unidentified coccidia genera were found in many samples. In particular, coccidian sequences formed a robust monophyletic clade with other protists identified in Agaricia, Favia, Montastraea, Mycetophyllia, Porites, and Siderastrea coral colonies. Moreover, Licnophora and coccidians had different distributions between the two geographic regions. A similar pattern was observed between Symbiodinium clades C and A/D.

Background: Metagenomic approaches have revealed the complexity of environmental microbiomes with the advancement in whole genome sequencing displaying a significant level of genetic heterogeneity on the species level. It has become apparent that patterns of superior bioactivity of bacteria applicable in biotechnology as well as the enhanced virulence of pathogens often requires distinguishing between closely related species or sub-species. Current methods for binning of metagenomic reads usually do not allow for identification below the genus level and generally stops at the family level. Results: In this work, an attempt was made to improve metagenomic binning resolution by creating genome specific barcodes based on the core and accessory genomes. This protocol was implemented in novel software tools available for use and download from http://bargene.bi.up.ac.za /. The most abundant barcode genes from the core genomes were found to encode for ribosomal proteins, certain central metabolic genes and ABC transporters. Performance of metabarcode sequences created by this package was evaluated using artificially generated and publically available metagenomic datasets. Furthermore, a program (Barcoding 2.0) was developed to align reads against barcode sequences and thereafter calculate various parameters to score the alignments and the individual barcodes. Taxonomic units were identified in metagenomic samples by comparison of the calculated barcode scores to set cut-off values. In this study, it was found that varying sample sizes, i.e. number of reads in a metagenome and metabarcode lengths, had no significant effect on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were calculated for different taxonomic groups based on the results of identification of the corresponding genomes in artificial metagenomic datasets.

Studying the dynamics of nitrogen and sulphur cycling bacteria in river surface sediments is essential to better understand their contribution to global biogeochemical cycles. Evaporitic rocks settled at the headwater of the Deba River catchment (northern Spain) lead to high values of sulphate concentration in its waters. Besides, the discharge of effluents from untreated and treated residual (urban and industrial) wastewaters increases the concentration of metals, nutrients and organic compounds in its mid- and low-water courses. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of anthropogenic contamination from untreated and treated residual and industrial wastewaters on the structure and function of bacterial communities present in surface sediments of the Deba River catchment. The application of a quantitative functional approach (qPCR) based on denitrification genes (nir: nirS + nirK; and nosZ), together with a 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding structural analysis, revealed (i) the high relevance of the sulphur cycle at headwater surface sediments (as reflected by the abundance of members of the Syntrophobacterales order, and the Sulfuricurvum and Thiobacillus genera) and (ii) the predominance of sulphide-driven autotrophic denitrification over heterotrophic denitrification. Incomplete heterotrophic denitrification appeared to be predominant in surface sediments strongly impacted by treated and untreated effluents, as reflected by the lower values of the nosZ/nir ratio, thus favouring N2O emissions. Understanding nitrogen and sulphur cycling pathways has profound implications for the management of river ecosystems, since this knowledge can help us determine whether a specific river is acting or not as a source of greenhouse gases (i.e., N2O).","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Autotrophic/heterotrophic denitrification | Metabarcoding | Nitrogen and sulphur cycling | qPCR (nir and nosZ) | River surface sediments","25349","IT1029-16","Eusko Jaurlaritza","0","FALSE","404","633",NA,"29758858",NA,NA,"S0048969718309884",2018

Soils harbour some of the most diverse microbiomes on Earth and are essential for both nutrient cycling and carbon storage. To understand soil functioning, it is necessary to model the global distribution patterns and functional gene repertoires of soil microorganisms, as well as the biotic and environmental associations between the diversity and structure of both bacterial and fungal soil communities 1–4 . Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.","34","Journal","le","Letter","100","21",NA,"21206","686070","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme","0","FALSE","405","560","7717","30069051",NA,NA,NA,2018

Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd As multiple species of bats are currently experiencing dramatic declines in populations due to white-nose syndrome (WNS) and other factors, conservation managers have an urgent need for data on the ecology and overall status of populations of once-common bat species. Standard approaches to obtain data on bat populations often involve capture and handling, requiring extensive expertise and unavoidably resulting in stress to the bats. New methods to rapidly obtain critical data are needed that minimize both the stress on bats and the spread of WNS. Guano provides a noninvasive source of DNA that includes information from the bat, but also dietary items, parasites, and pathogens. DNA metabarcoding is a high-throughput, DNA-based identification technique to assess the biodiversity of environmental or fecal samples. We investigated the use of multifaceted DNA metabarcoding (MDM), a technique combining next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS), DNA barcodes, and bioinformatic analysis, to simultaneously collect data on multiple parameters of interest (bat species composition, individual genotype, sex ratios, diet, parasites, and presence of WNS) from fecal samples using a single NGS run. We tested the accuracy of each MDM assay using samples in which these parameters were previously determined using conventional approaches. We found that assays for bat species identification, insect diet, parasite diversity, and genotype were both sensitive and accurate, the assay to detect WNS was highly sensitive but requires careful sample processing steps to ensure the reliability of results, while assays for nectivorous diet and sex showed lower sensitivity. MDM was able to quantify multiple data classes from fecal samples simultaneously, and results were consistent whether we included assays for a single data class or multiple data classes. Overall, MDM is a useful approach that employs noninvasive sampling and a customizable suite of assays to gain important and largely accurate information on bat ecology and population dynamics.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","bats | DNA metabarcoding | next-generation DNA sequencing | noninvasive sampling | population assessment","19400157205","14 E-RC3-018","University of California, Davis","1","TRUE","406","11","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Metabarcoding allows the genetic analysis of pooled samples of various sources. It is becoming popular in the study of animal diet, especially because it allows the analysis of the composition of feces without the need of handling animals. In this work, we studied the diet of the Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus), a small semi-aquatic mammal endemic to the Iberian Peninsula and the Pyrenees, by sequencing COI minibarcodes from feces using next-generation sequencing techniques. For the identification of assembled sequences, we employed a tree-based identification method that used a reference tree of sequences of freshwater organisms. The comparison of freshly collected fecal samples and older samples showed that fresh samples produced significantly more sequencing reads. They also rendered more operational taxonomical units (OTUs), but not significantly. Our analyses of 41 samples identified 224 OTUs corresponding to species of the reference tree. Ephemeroptera, Diptera excl. Chironomidae, and Chironomidae were the most highly represented groups in terms of reads as well as samples. Other groups of freshwater organisms detected were Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Neuropteroida, Coleoptera, Crustacea, and Annelida. Our results are largely in line with previous morphological and genetic studies on the diet of the Pyrenean desman, but allowed the identification of a higher diversity of OTUs in each sample. Additionally, the bioinformatic pipeline we developed for deep sequencing of fecal samples will enable the quantitative analysis of the diet of this and other species, which can be highly useful to determine their ecological requirements.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"10600153309","074119","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad","1","TRUE","407","13","8","30106960","e0201763",NA,NA,2018

Rivers are a vital resource for human wellbeing. To reduce human impact on water bodies, the European Union has established an essential regulatory framework for protection and sustainable management (WFD; 2000/60/EC). In this strategy, reliable and economic bioindicators are a fundamental component. Benthic macroinvertebrates are the group most commonly used as bioindicators through all European countries. However, their conventional assessment currently entails serious cost-efficiency limitations. In this study, we have tested the reliability of metabarcoding as a tool to record river macroinvertebrates using samples from a mock community (in vitro validation) and eDNA extracted for field validation from water from six sites within a north Iberian river (River Nalón, Asturias, Spain). Two markers (V4 region within the nuclear 18S rDNA and a fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene) were amplified and sequenced using an Illumina platform. The molecular technique has proven to be more sensitive than the visual one. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the metabarcoding approach is more expensive than conventional techniques for determining macroinvertebrate communities but requires fewer sampling and identification efforts. Our results suggest metabarcoding is a useful tool for alternative assessment of freshwater quality.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","408","13","8","30089147","e0201741",NA,NA,2018

DNA metabarcoding is a sophisticated molecular tool that can enhance biological surveys of freshwater plankton communities by providing broader taxonomic coverage and, for certain groups, higher taxonomic resolution compared to morphological methods. We conducted 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding analyses on 214 water samples collected over a four-month period from multiple sites within a freshwater reservoir. We detected 1,314 unique operational taxonomic units that included various metazoans, protists, chlorophytes, and fungi. Alpha diversity differed among sites, suggesting local habitat variation linked to differing species responses. Strong temporal variation was detected at both daily and monthly scales. Diversity and relative abundance patterns for several protist groups (including dinoflagellates, ciliates, and cryptophytes) differed from arthropods (e.g., cladocerans and copepods), a traditional focus of plankton surveys. This suggests that the protists respond to different environmental dimensions and may therefore provide additional information regarding ecosystem status. Comparison of the sequence-based population survey data to conventional-based data revealed similar trends for taxa that were ranked among the most abundant in both approaches, although some groups were missing in each data set. These results highlight the potential benefit of supplementing conventional biological survey approaches with metabarcoding to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of freshwater plankton community structure and dynamics.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Aquatic arthropods | Biological survey | Community dynamics | Protists","15168","undefined","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency","0","FALSE","409","818","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

These patterns are elucidated using blood meal analysis, a collection of serological and molecular techniques that determine the taxonomic identities of the host animals from which blood meals are derived. Modern blood meal analyses rely on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing, and bioinformatic comparisons of blood meal DNA sequences to reference databases. Ideally, primers used in blood meal analysis PCRs amplify templates from a taxonomically diverse range of vertebrates, produce a short amplicon, and avoid co-amplification of non-target templates. Few primer sets that fit these requirements are available for the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, the species identification marker with the highest taxonomic coverage in reference databases. Here, we present new primer sets designed to amplify fragments of the DNA barcoding region of the vertebrate COI gene, while avoiding co-amplification of mosquito templates, without multiplexed or nested PCR. Primers were validated using host vertebrate DNA templates from mosquito blood meals of known origin, representing all terrestrial vertebrate classes, and field-collected mosquito blood meals of unknown origin. We found that the primers were generally effective in amplifying vertebrate host, but not mosquito DNA templates. Applied to the sample of unknown mosquito blood meals, > 98% (60/61) of blood meals samples were reliably identified, demonstrating the feasibility of identifying mosquito hosts with the new primers. These primers are beneficial in that they can be used to amplify COI templates from a diverse range of vertebrate hosts using standard PCR, thereby streamlining the process of identifying the hosts of mosquitoes, and could be applied to next generation DNA sequencing and metabarcoding approaches.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"11900154404","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","410","12","8","30161128",NA,NA,NA,2018

Arthropod vectors are responsible for the transmission of human pathogens worldwide. Several arthropod species are bird ectoparasites, however, no study to date has characterized their microbiota as a whole. We sampled hematophagous ectoparasites that feed on migratory birds and performed 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding to characterize their microbial community. A total of 194 ectoparasites were collected from 115 avian hosts and classified into three groups: a) Hippoboscidae diptera; b) ticks; c) other arthropods. Metabarcoding showed that endosymbionts were the most abundant genera of the microbial community, including Wolbachia for Hippoboscidae diptera, Candidatus Midichloria for ticks, Wolbachia and Arsenophonus for the other arthropod group. Genera including pathogenic species were: Rickettsia, Borrelia, Coxiella, Francisella, Bartonella, Anaplasma. Co-infection with Borrelia-Rickettsia and Anaplasma-Rickettsia was also observed. A global overview of the microbiota of ectoparasites sampled from migratory birds was obtained with the use of 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. A novel finding is the first identification of Rickettsia in the common swift louse fly, Crataerina pallida. Given their possible interaction with pathogenic viruses and bacteria, the presence of endosymbionts in arthropods merits attention. Finally, molecular characterization of genera, including both pathogenic and symbiont species, plays a pivotal role in the design of targeted molecular diagnostics.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","13",NA,"10600153309","undefined","Ministério da Saúde","1","TRUE","411","13","8","30148833","e0202270",NA,NA,2018

The rhizospheric microbiome is clearly affected by plant species and certain of their functional traits. These functional traits allow plants to adapt to their environmental conditions by acquiring or conserving nutrients, thus defining different ecological resource-use plant strategies. In the present study, we investigated whether plants with one of the two nutrient-use strategies (conservative versus exploitative) could influence fungal communities involved in soil organic matter degradation and root exudate assimilation, as well as those colonizing root tissues. We applied a DNA-based, stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP) approach to four grass species distributed along a gradient of plant nutrient resource strategies, ranging from conservative to exploitative species, and analyzed their associated mycobiota composition using a fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and Glomeromycotina 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding approach. Our results demonstrated that fungal taxa associated with exploitative and conservative plants could be separated into two general categories according to their location: generalists, which are broadly distributed among plants from each strategy and represent the core mycobiota of soil organic matter degraders, root exudate consumers in the root-adhering soil, and root colonizers; and specialists, which are locally abundant in one species and more specifically involved in soil organic matter degradation or root exudate assimilation on the root-adhering soil and the root tissues.

Marine plankton populate 70% of Earth’s surface, providing the energy that fuels ocean food webs and contributing to global biogeochemical cycles. Plankton communities are extremely diverse and geographically variable, and are overwhelmingly composed of low-abundance species. The role of this rare biosphere and its ecological underpinnings are however still unclear. Here, we analyse the extensive dataset generated by the Tara Oceans expedition for marine microbial eukaryotes (protists) and use an adaptive algorithm to explore how metabarcoding-based abundance distributions vary across plankton communities in the global ocean. We show that the decay in abundance of non-dominant operational taxonomic units, which comprise over 99% of local richness, is commonly governed by a power-law. Despite the high spatial turnover in species composition, the power-law exponent varies by less than 10% across locations and shows no biogeographical signature, but is weakly modulated by cell size. Such striking regularity suggests that the assembly of plankton communities in the dynamic and highly variable ocean environment is governed by large-scale ubiquitous processes. Understanding their origin and impact on plankton ecology will be important for evaluating the resilience of marine biodiversity in a changing ocean.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"21100831440","NSF PHY-1125915","National Science Foundation","0","FALSE","413","2","8","29915345",NA,NA,NA,2018

Here, in situ microbiotas from the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area of the Yangtze River were characterized by DNA metabarcoding approaches, and then, changes of in situ microbiotas were compared with the ecotoxicological endpoint, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediated activity, and level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediments.

Specifically, Shannon indices of protistan communities were negatively correlated with the levels of AhR mediated activity and PAHs. The sediment AhR activity was positively correlated with the relative abundance of prokaryotic Acetobacteraceae, but had a negative correlation with protistan Oxytrichidae. Furthermore, a quantitative classification model was built to predict the level of AhR activity based on the relative abundances of Acetobacteraceae and Oxytrichidae.

However, since the archipelago was first settled by humans 750 y ago, its unique biodiversity has been under pressure, and today an estimated 49% of the terrestrial avifauna is extinct. Current efforts to conserve the remaining fauna rely on a better understanding of the composition of past ecosystems, as well as the causes and timing of past extinctions. The exact temporal and spatial dynamics of New Zealand’s extinct fauna, however, can be difficult to interpret, as only a small proportion of animals are preserved as morphologically identifiable fossils. Here, we conduct a large-scale genetic survey of subfossil bone assemblages to elucidate the impact of humans on the environment in New Zealand. By genetically identifying more than 5,000 nondiagnostic bone fragments from archaeological and paleontological sites, we reconstruct a rich faunal record of 110 species of birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and marine mammals.

Taken together, this molecular audit of New Zealand’s subfossil record not only contributes to our understanding of past biodiversity and precontact Maori subsistence practices but also provides a more nuanced snapshot of anthropogenic impacts on native fauna after first human arrival.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","14","Ancient DNA | Bulk bone metabarcoding | Human impacts | Paleoecology | Subsistence practices","21121","DP160104473","Australian Research Council","1","TRUE","417","115","30","29987016",NA,NA,NA,2018

Opisthokonta represents a major lineage of eukaryotes and includes fungi and metazoans, as well as other less known unicellular groups. The latter are paraphyletic assemblages that branch in between the former two groups, and thus are important for understanding the origin and early diversification of opisthokonts. The full range of their diversity, however, has not yet been explored from diverse ecological habitats. Freshwater environments are crucial sources for new diversity; they are considered even more heterogeneous than marine ecosystems. This heterogeneity implies more ecological niches where local eukaryotic communities are located. However, knowledge of the unicellular opisthokont diversity is scarce from freshwater environments. Here, we performed an 18S rDNA metabarcoding study in the Middle Paraná River, Argentina, to characterize the molecular diversity of microbial eukaryotes, in particular unicellular members of Opisthokonta. We identified a potential novel clade branching as a sister-group to Fungi. We also detected in our data that more than 60% operational taxonomic units classified as unicellular holozoans (animals and relatives) represent new taxa at the species level. Of the remaining, the majority was assigned to the newly described holozoan species, Syssomonas multiformis. Together, our results show that a large hidden diversity of unicellular members of opisthokonts still remain to be uncovered. We also found that the geographical and ecological distribution of several taxa considered exclusive to marine environments is wider than previously thought.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Early-branching Holomycota | Freshwater | Metabarcoding | Molecular diversity | Paraná river | Unicellular Holozoa","21100834704","ERC-2012-Co-616960","European Research Council","1","TRUE","418","6","JUL",NA,"99","ERC",NA,2018

Despite the increasing knowledge on the processes involved in the acquisition and development of the gut microbiota in model organisms, the factors influencing early microbiota successions in natural populations remain poorly understood. In particular, little is known on the role of the rearing environment in the establishment of the gut microbiota in wild birds. Here, we examined the influence of the nesting environment on the gut microbiota of Great tits (Parus major) by performing a partial cross-fostering experiment during the intermediate stage of nestling development. We found that the cloacal microbiota of great tit nestlings underwent substantial changes between 8 and 15 days of age, with a strong decrease in diversity, an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and a shift in the functional features of the community. Second, the nesting environment significantly influenced community composition, with a divergence among separated true siblings and a convergence among foster siblings. Third, larger shifts in both microbiota diversity and composition correlated with lower nestling body condition. Our results shed new light on the dynamics of microbial diversity during the ontogeny of avian hosts, indicating that the nest environment continues to shape the gut microbiota during the later stages of nestling development and that the increase in gut diversity between hatching and adulthood may not be as linear as previously suspected. Lastly, the microbiota changes incurred during this period may have implications for nestling body condition which can lead to long-term consequences for host fitness.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","16S amplicon metabarcoding | Bacterial communities | Cloaca | Colonization | Growth | Microbiome | Ontogeny | Songbird","21100226442","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","419","9","JUL",NA,"1524",NA,NA,2018

A total of 252 aerial spore samples from the provinces of Quebec and Ontario were obtained during an extensive research programme focusing on aerobiology of fungal spores. Samples were collected on 95 sticky rods from rotary arm spore collectors and 157 filters from passive rain collectors. DNA from samples was PCR-amplified for fungal ribosomal ITS and sequenced using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) methods. After bioinformatics analysis of DNA sequences, the presence of Diplodia corticola, an emerging tree pathogen in North America, was observed. In total, 313 DNA sequence reads from aerial spores of D. corticola were found in the Illumina data set, and 199 DNA sequence reads were obtained from the Ion Torrent data set. DNA of D. corticola was found in 16 of the 32 sampled sites, always less than 10 reads per site, with the exception of three sites–Quebec City, Aylmer and Ottawa–where 287, 125 and 73 DNA reads, respectively, were detected. This is not a first report of the presence of D. corticola causing a tree disease in Canada as symptomatic trees have not been identified. Typically, like many other species of the Botryosphaeriaceae, this fungal pathogen is believed to be an opportunistic plant endophyte capable of living asymptomatically for several years before showing up as a pathogen when conducive conditions arise. Its presence as singletons in nearly half the sampled sites in Quebec and Ontario may be the result of long-distance spore dispersal originating from known infected sites in Massachusetts, Maine and other unknown sites in the north-eastern USA. However, its much higher read counts in three sites may indicate the possibility of a few trees being asymptomatically infected and spreading conidia locally.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Forest pathogens | fungi | Illumina | invasive species | Ion Torrent | ITS1 | metabarcoding","17405","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","421","40","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Following an introduction to some common HTS technologies, we discuss how metabarcoding can accelerate algal species discovery. We show how various HTS methods can be applied to generate datasets for accurate species delimitation, and how HTS can be applied to historical type specimens to assist the nomenclature process. Finally, we discuss how HTS data such as organellar genomes and transcriptomes can be used to construct well-resolved phylogenies, leading to a stable and natural classification of algal groups. We include examples of bioinformatic workflows that may be applied to process data for each purpose, along with common programs used to achieve each step. We also discuss possible strategies and the new skill set that will be required to fully embrace HTS as a part of algal systematics, along with considerations of cost and experimental design.

Diets during critical brooding and winter periods likely influence the growth of Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) populations. During the brooding period, rapidly growing Lesser Prairie-Chicken chicks have high calorie demands and are restricted to foods within immediate surroundings. For adults and juveniles during cold winters, meeting thermoregulatory demands with available food items of limited nutrient content may be challenging. Our objective was to determine the primary animal and plant components of Lesser Prairie-Chicken diets among native prairie, cropland, and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields in Kansas and Colorado, USA, during brooding and winter using a DNA metabarcoding approach. Lesser Prairie-Chicken fecal samples (n = 314) were collected during summer 2014 and winter 2014-2015, DNA was extracted, amplified, and sequenced. A region of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene was sequenced to determine the arthropod component of the diet, and a portion of the trnL intron region was used to determine the plant component. Relying on fecal DNA to quantify dietary composition, as opposed to traditional visual identification of gut contents, revealed a greater proportion of soft-bodied arthropods than previously recorded. Among 80 fecal samples for which threshold arthropod DNA reads were obtained, 35% of the sequences were most likely from Lepidoptera, 26% from Orthoptera, 14% from Araneae, 13% from Hemiptera, and 12% from other orders. Plant sequences from 137 fecal samples were composed of species similar to Ambrosia (27%), followed by species similar to Lactuca or Taraxacum (10%), Medicago (6%), and Triticum (5%). Forbs were the predominant (>50% of reads) plant food consumed during both brood rearing and winter. The importance both of native forbs and of a broad array of arthropods that rely on forbs suggests that disturbance regimes that promote forbs may be crucial in providing food for Lesser Prairie-Chickens in the northern portion of their distribution.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","Arthropods | diet | DNA metabarcoding | foraging | forbs | grasslands | grouse | invertebrates | Lesser PrairieChicken | Tympanuchus pallidicinctus","20977","KSCFWRU RWO 62","Natural Resources Conservation Service","0","FALSE","424","135","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Journal of Animal Ecology published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society. Pollination by insects is a key ecosystem service and important to wider ecosystem function. Most species-level pollination networks studied have a generalised structure, with plants having several potential pollinators, and pollinators in turn visiting a number of different plant species. This is in apparent contrast to a plant's need for efficient conspecific pollen transfer. The aim of this study was to investigate the structure of pollen transport networks at three levels of biological hierarchy: community, species and individual. We did this using hoverflies in the genus Eristalis, a key group of non-Hymenopteran pollinators. We constructed pollen transport networks using DNA metabarcoding to identify pollen. We captured hoverflies in conservation grasslands in west Wales, UK, removed external pollen loads, sequenced the pollen DNA on the Illumina MiSeq platform using the standard plant barcode rbcL, and matched sequences using a pre-existing plant DNA barcode reference library. We found that Eristalis hoverflies transport pollen from 65 plant taxa, more than previously appreciated. Networks were generalised at the site and species level, suggesting some degree of functional redundancy, and were more generalised in late summer compared to early summer. In contrast, pollen transport at the individual level showed some degree of specialisation. Hoverflies defined as “single-plant visitors” varied from 40% of those captured in early summer to 24% in late summer. Individual hoverflies became more generalised in late summer, possibly in response to an increase in floral resources. Rubus fruticosus agg. and Succisa pratensis were key plant species for hoverflies at our sites Our results contribute to resolving the apparent paradox of how generalised pollinator networks can provide efficient pollination to plant species. Generalised hoverfly pollen transport networks may result from a varied range of short-term specialised feeding bouts by individual insects. The generalisation and functional redundancy of Eristalis pollen transport networks may increase the stability of the pollination service they deliver.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","DNA metabarcoding | generalisation | grassland | hoverfly | pollination | pollination networks | specialisation","29544","undefined","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","1","TRUE","425","87","4","29658115",NA,NA,NA,2018

However, it is unclear as to whether these apparent differences reflect biological realities or methodologies in community characterization: free-living eukaryotes tend to be characterized using metabarcoding whereas symbiont eukaryotes are typically characterized with microscopy. Here, we utilize an Illumina high-throughput metabarcoding approach to characterize the diversity and dynamics of eukaryotic symbiont communities in the feces of a wild non-human primate, Macaca fascicularis, revealing functionally and taxonomically diverse communities of eukaryotes hitherto unreported from any vertebrate. Importantly, community assembly was consistent with top-down and bottom-up trophic food web dynamics, highlighting the applicability of macroecological principles to these communities. Ultimately, our findings highlight vertebrate-associated symbiont communities of the gut that are much more similar to free-living systems than previously realized.

Here, in a diverse tropical forest in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, we couple DNA metabarcoding with a sampling design that controls for host phylogeny, host age, and habitat variation, to characterize fungal communities associated with the roots of three confamilial pairs of host species that exhibit contrasting (high and low) relative abundances. We uncovered a functionally and phylogenetically diverse fungal community composed of 1,038 OTUs (operational taxonomic units with 97% genetic similarity), only 14 of which exhibited host specificity. Host species was a significant predictor of fungal community composition only for the subset of OTUs composed of putatively pathogenic fungi. We found no significant difference in the number of specialists associating with common versus rare trees, but we found that host abundance was negatively correlated with the diversity of root fungal communities. This latter result was significant for symbiotrophs (mostly arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and, to a lesser extent, for pathotrophs (mostly plant pathogens). Thus, root fungal communities differ between common and rare trees, which may impact the strength of conspecific negative density dependence.

However, to better understand patterns of plant–fungal associations, the combined effects of abiotic and biotic drivers across environmental gradients may be important. We investigated the effects of temperature, pH, soil moisture, vegetation cover and distance to host plant on the occurrence and abundance of fungi associated with Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra). We did this by DNA metabarcoding 288 soil samples taken across and beyond the elevation range of P. cembra (i.e. 1,850–2,250 m a.s.l.) in two valleys in the Swiss Alps. We modelled the effects of abiotic and biotic factors on DNA read abundance of pathogenic and mutualistic fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) associated with P. cembra. We also tested whether abiotic and biotic factors differentially affected fungi of varying host specificity (i.e. host generalists, host specialists). We found that the occurrences of both host generalist and specialist fungi exceeded the current elevational range of their host plant. Abiotic factors had only minor effects on the abundances of all fungal OTUs. However, we found positive effects of the host plant on the abundance of a host specialist pathogenic fungus, providing support for a Janzen–Connell effect of high pathogen accumulation close to conspecific host plants. We also found a positive response to the host plant in a specialist ectomycorrhizal fungus, suggesting an “inverse” Janzen–Connell effect. Synthesis. Our findings imply that negative distance dependence shapes not only the distribution of host-specific fungal pathogens, but also host-specific fungal mutualists. We conclude that the occurrence of both pathogenic and mutualistic fungi beyond the current elevational range of host plants may determine their potential range shifts under projected climate warming.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","DNA metabarcoding | host specificity | Janzen–Connell hypothesis | Pinus cembra | plant–fungal interactions | plant–soil (below-ground) interactions | plant–soil feedback | Swiss stone pine","29602","NE 1863/2-1","California Department of Fish and Game","0","FALSE","428","106","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Genetic taxonomic assignment can be more sensitive than morphological taxonomic assignment, particularly for small, cryptic or rare species. Sequence processing is essential to taxonomic assignment, but can also produce errors because optimal parameters are not known a priori. Here, we explored how sequence processing parameters influence taxonomic assignment of 18S sequences from bulk zooplankton samples produced by 454 pyrosequencing. We optimized a sequence processing pipeline for two common research goals, estimation of species richness and early detection of aquatic invasive species (AIS), and then tested most optimal models’ performances through simulations. We tested 1,050 parameter sets on 18S sequences from 20 AIS to determine optimal parameters for each research goal. We tested optimized pipelines’ performances (detectability and sensitivity) by computationally inoculating sequences of 20 AIS into ten bulk zooplankton samples from ports across Canada. We found that optimal parameter selection generally depends on the research goal. However, regardless of research goal, we found that metazoan 18S sequences produced by 454 pyrosequencing should be trimmed to 375–400 bp and sequence quality filtering should be relaxed (1.5 = maximum expected error = 3.0, Phred score = 10). Clustering and denoising were only viable for estimating species richness, because these processing steps made some species undetectable at low sequence abundances which would not be useful for early detection of AIS. With parameter sets optimized for early detection of AIS, 90% of AIS were detected with fewer than 11 target sequences, regardless of whether clustering or denoising was used. Despite developments in next-generation sequencing, sequence processing remains an important issue owing to difficulties in balancing false-positive and false-negative errors in metabarcoding data.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","aquatic invasive species | biomonitoring | clustering | high-throughput sequencing | metabarcoding | sequence processing","19400157205","undefined","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","1","TRUE","429","11","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

We screened the coral genome (using restriction site-associated sequencing) and characterized both the dinoflagellate photosymbiont- and tissue-associated prokaryote microbiomes (using metabarcoding) of a reef flat and slope population of the reef-building coral, Pocillopora damicornis, at two locations on Heron Island in the southern Great Barrier Reef. Reef flat and slope populations were separated by <100 m horizontally and ~5 m vertically, and the two study locations were separated by ~1 km. For the coral host, genetic divergence between habitats was much greater than between locations, suggesting limited gene flow between the flat and slope populations. Consistent with environmental selection, outlier loci primarily belonged to the conserved, minimal cellular stress response, likely reflecting adaptation to the different temperature and irradiance regimes on the reef flat and slope. The prokaryote community differed across both habitat and, to a lesser extent, location, whereas the dinoflagellate photosymbionts differed by habitat but not location. The observed intraspecific diversity associated with divergent habitats supports that environmental adaptation involves multiple members of the coral holobiont.

Through soil metabarcoding analysis we compared richness and species composition among macrofungal communities, belonging to Agaricales, Russulales, Boletales and Phallomycetidae groups, in three elevational forests types in the subtropical Yungas of Northwestern Argentina (Piedmont forest; Montane forest, Montane cloud forest). The aims of this study were to assess richness of taxonomic and functional groups along the elevation gradient and to assess the relationships between environmental variables and species composition in the studied fungal communities. The results have shown rich Agaricomycetes communities, diversely structured among forests habitats. The elevation gradient differentially affected the richness and distribution of Agaricales, Russulales, Boletales and Phallomycetidae. Based on fungal trophic modes and guilds, the gradient also affected the ectomycorrhizal taxa distribution. When considering the basidiomata growth forms (agaricoid, boletoid, gasteroid, etc.), only the secotioid type showed significant elevational differences. Additional analyses indicated that saprotrophic nutritional mode was dominant along the entire gradient, being partially replaced by biotrophic modes at higher elevations. Fungal communities in the Montane cloud forests are most dissimilar when compared with communities at the Piedmont forest and Montane forest, which is consistent with the different biogeographic origins of these forests.

Morphological identification of these organisms is a time-consuming and expensive procedure. Here, we assess the options for complementing and, perhaps, replacing morphological identification with procedures using eDNA, metabarcoding or similar approaches. We rate the applicability of DNA-based identification for the individual BQEs and water categories (rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters) against eleven criteria, summarised under the headlines representativeness (for example suitability of current sampling methods for DNA-based identification, errors from DNA-based species detection), sensitivity (for example capability to detect sensitive taxa, unassigned reads), precision of DNA-based identification (knowledge about uncertainty), comparability with conventional approaches (for example sensitivity of metrics to differences in DNA-based identification), cost effectiveness and environmental impact. Overall, suitability of DNA-based identification is particularly high for fish, as eDNA is a well-suited sampling approach which can replace expensive and potentially harmful methods such as gill-netting, trawling or electrofishing. Furthermore, there are attempts to replace absolute by relative abundance in metric calculations. For invertebrates and phytobenthos, the main challenges include the modification of indices and completing barcode libraries. For phytoplankton, the barcode libraries are even more problematic, due to the high taxonomic diversity in plankton samples. If current assessment concepts are kept, DNA-based identification is least appropriate for macrophytes (rivers, lakes) and angiosperms/macroalgae (transitional and coastal waters), which are surveyed rather than sampled. We discuss general implications of implementing DNA-based identification into standard ecological assessment, in particular considering any adaptations to the WFD that may be required to facilitate the transition to molecular data.","14","Journal","re","Review","100","17","Biological quality elements | eDNA | Lakes | Meta-barcoding | Rivers | Transitional and coastal waters","18795","CA15219","European Geosciences Union","0","FALSE","436","138",NA,"29602086",NA,NA,"S0043135418301830",2018

We measured soil chemistry (total N, C, extractable PO 4 , soil pH, cation exchange capacity [ECEC], percent base saturation [% BS]) and dissected soil fungal communities using ITS2 metabarcode Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Total soil N, C, PO 4 , % BS, and pH increased with elevation and plateaued at approximately 1400 m, whereas ECEC linearly increased and C/N decreased with elevation. Fungal communities differed among locations and were correlated with all chemical variables, except PO 4 , whereas OTU richness increased with total N. Several ecological guilds (i.e., ectomycorrhizae, saprotrophs, plant pathogens) differed in abundance among locations; specifically, saprotroph abundance, primarily attributable to genus Mortierella, was positively correlated with elevation. Ectomycorrhizae declined with total N and soil pH and increased with total C and PO 4 where plant pathogens increased with total N and decreased with total C.

Nuclear eDNA fragments have also been proposed as targets, but little is known about their persistence in the aquatic environment. Here we measure the abundance of mitochondrial eDNA fragments of different lengths and of short nuclear eDNA fragments, originating from captive fish in experimental tanks, and we test whether longer mitochondrial and short nuclear fragments decay faster than short mitochondrial fragments following fish removal. We show that when fish are present, shorter mitochondrial fragments are more abundant in water samples than both longer mitochondrial fragments and short nuclear eDNA fragments. However, the rate of decay following fish removal was similar for all fragment types, suggesting that the differences in abundance resulted from differences in the rates at which different fragment types were produced rather than differences in their decay rates.","11","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"21537","164","Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment","0","FALSE","438","52","11",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

This study compares two DNA plant barcoding markers that are commonly used for dietary analyses from degraded DNA, rbcL and trnL, to detailed dietary observations of wild white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus). Observational dietary data and fecal samples (n = 170) were collected for one year from a group of individually recognizable monkeys at La Suerte Biological Field Station, Costa Rica. DNA was extracted and portions of the rbcL and trnL chloroplast were amplified and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequences were analyzed using obitools. Of the two barcoding markers tested, trnL yielded greater numbers of sequences with equal sequencing effort, higher resolution taxonomic identifications (albeit with a larger reference database), and identified a greater number of families also found in the observed diet. There was no relationship between observed capuchin feeding behavior and dietary composition based on either sequence occurrence or relative abundance of sequences using rbcL as a marker. However, dietary composition based on the relative abundance of trnL sequences was significantly positively associated with the observed percentage of feeding and foraging time capuchins’ spent on each plant species. Additionally, in 35% of cases, the relative abundance of trnL sequences assigned to particular plant families in fecal samples was highly positively correlated with time spent consuming plants from those same families. Our results indicate that trnL is a more robust DNA metabarcoding marker for plant dietary analysis and may potentially be used to quantitatively assess differences in diet within or between species.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"10600153309","undefined","University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","1","TRUE","440","13","6","29944686","e0199556","UIUC",NA,2018

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a rapid, cost-effective, non-invasive biodiversity monitoring tool which utilises DNA left behind in the environment by organisms for species detection. The method is used as a species-specific survey tool for rare or invasive species across a broad range of ecosystems. Recently, eDNA and “metabarcoding” have been combined to describe whole communities rather than focusing on single target species. However, whether metabarcoding is as sensitive as targeted approaches for rare species detection remains to be evaluated. The great crested newt Triturus cristatus is a flagship pond species of international conservation concern and the first UK species to be routinely monitored using eDNA. We evaluate whether eDNA metabarcoding has comparable sensitivity to targeted real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for T. cristatus detection. Extracted eDNA samples (N = 532) were screened for T. cristatus by qPCR and analysed for all vertebrate species using high-throughput sequencing technology. With qPCR and a detection threshold of 1 of 12 positive qPCR replicates, newts were detected in 50% of ponds. Detection decreased to 32% when the threshold was increased to 4 of 12 positive qPCR replicates. With metabarcoding, newts were detected in 34% of ponds without a detection threshold, and in 28% of ponds when a threshold (0.028%) was applied. Therefore, qPCR provided greater detection than metabarcoding but metabarcoding detection with no threshold was equivalent to qPCR with a stringent detection threshold. The proportion of T. cristatus sequences in each sample was positively associated with the number of positive qPCR replicates (qPCR score) suggesting eDNA metabarcoding may be indicative of eDNA concentration. eDNA metabarcoding holds enormous potential for holistic biodiversity assessment and routine freshwater monitoring. We advocate this community approach to freshwater monitoring to guide management and conservation, whereby entire communities can be initially surveyed to best inform use of funding and time for species-specific surveys.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","environmental DNA | great crested newt | high-throughput sequencing | metabarcoding | ponds | real-time quantitative PCR | Triturus cristatus","21100264002","undefined","University of Hull","1","TRUE","441","8","12",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

We hypothesised that eDNA inferences are more consistent with fish assemblages observed upstream than downstream due to a directional flow of river water. River water was sampled at 102 sites in 51 rivers around Lake Biwa in the central part of Honshu Island, Japan, within 10 person-days, and fish species compositions inferred from eDNA and existing observational data were compared. Observation sites were chosen from the observational data that were within a certain distance (buffer range) of a water-sampling site along a river trajectory. The hypothesis of the detection bias of eDNA towards upstream assemblage was tested by comparing results with all of the observational data, data from a higher elevation and data from a lower elevation. The Jaccard dissimilarity index was plotted between the observational data and the eDNA estimates against the buffer range; the buffer range with minimum dissimilarity was chosen. When using existing observational data from within 6 km upstream of the eDNA sampling sites, the eDNA results were the most consistent with the observational data and inferred 86.4% of the species reported (38/44), as well as two additional species. eDNA results also showed patterns consistent with known upstream–downstream turnover of related species and biogeographical assemblage patterns of certain species. Our 10-person-days survey using the metabarcoding technique enabled us to obtain as much regional fish diversity data including the hypothesised pattern of eDNA detection with an upstream bias as the accumulated observational data obtained through greater amounts of time, money and labour. The problems regarding false-positive/negative detection were suggested in our survey; however, these should be decreased or removed by modifying the sampling methods and experimental procedures in future works.

Techniques based on high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of environmental DNA have provided a new way of studying fungal diversity. However, these techniques suffer from a number of methodological biases which may appear at any of the steps involved in a metabarcoding study. Air is one of the most important environments where fungi can be found, because it is the primary medium of dispersal for many species. Looking ahead to future developments, it was decided to test 20 protocols, including different passive spore traps, spore recovery procedures, DNA extraction kits, and barcode loci. HTS was performed with the Illumina MiSeq platform targeting two subloci of the fungal internal transcribed spacer. Multivariate analysis and generalized linear models showed that the type of passive spore trap, the spore recovery procedure, and the barcode all impact the description of fungal communities in terms of richness and diversity when assessed by HTS metabarcoding. In contrast, DNA extraction kits did not significantly impact these results. Although passive traps may be used to describe airborne fungal communities, a study using specific real-time PCR and a mock community showed that these kinds of traps are affected by environmental conditions that may induce losses of biological material, impacting diversity and community composition results.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Aerobiology | Fungal dispersion | Fungal diversity | Metabarcoding","19618","COST","European Cooperation in Science and Technology","1","TRUE","444","84","11","29572213","e02637-17",NA,NA,2018

The cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene is the main mitochondrial molecular marker playing a pivotal role in phylogenetic research and is a crucial barcode sequence. Folmer’s “universal” primers designed to amplify this gene in metazoan invertebrates allowed quick and easy barcode and phylogenetic analysis. On the other hand, the increase in the number of studies on barcoding leads to more frequent publishing of incorrect sequences, due to amplification of non-target taxa, and insufficient analysis of the obtained sequences. Consequently, some sequences deposited in genetic databases are incorrectly described as obtained from invertebrates, while being in fact bacterial sequences. In our study, in which we used Folmer’s primers to amplify COI sequences of the crustacean fairy shrimp Branchipus schaefferi (Fischer 1834), we also obtained COI sequences of microbial contaminants from Aeromonas sp. However, when we searched the GenBank database for sequences closely matching these contaminations we found entries described as representatives of Gastrotricha and Mollusca. When these entries were compared with other sequences bearing the same names in the database, the genetic distance between the incorrect and correct sequences amplified from the same species was c.a. 65%. Although the responsibility for the correct molecular identification of species rests on researchers, the errors found in already published sequences data have not been re-evaluated so far. On the basis of the standard sampling technique we have estimated with 95% probability that the chances of finding incorrectly described metazoan sequences in the GenBank depend on the systematic group, and variety from less than 1% (Mollusca and Arthropoda) up to 6.9% (Gastrotricha). Consequently, the increasing popularity of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding analysis may lead to overestimation of species diversity. Finally, the study also discusses the sources of the problems with amplification of non-target sequences.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"10600153309","538-L260-B518-17-1M","Politechnika Gdanska","1","TRUE","445","13","6","29933389","e0199609","PG",NA,2018

Soil fungal pathogens are the most common cause of diseases in commercial strawberry crops worldwide. Since simultaneous infections by different pathogens can severely damage the crop, understanding the associated fungal communities can be helpful to mitigate crop loss. Herein, we used Illumina metabarcoding to assess the structure of fungal communities in five strawberry production areas in Estonia. Our analysis revealed 990 to 1430 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) per soil sample (pools of eight soil samples per production area). Based on our analyses, Ascomycota (55.5%) and Basidiomycota (25.0%) were the most OTUs-rich. Amongst the 24 most abundant OTUs, Geomyces, Rhodotorula, Verticillium and Microdochium were the most abundant genera, which were found across nearly all the soil samples. The OTUs were also clustered into three distinct groups, corresponding to different functional guilds of fungi. In addition, Fusarium solani, V. dahliae, Rhizoctonia solani and Colletotrichum truncatum were enormously abundant in the fields with disease symptoms, whereas arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi especially Rhizophagus irregularis were considerably more abundant in the fields with healthy plants. These findings provide support that mycorrhizal fungi may play an important role in suppressing pathogens.

These structures are also habitats for many other microscopic organisms, including other fungi, which vary in their specificity and interaction with the whole symbiotic system. This contribution reviews the recent progress regarding the understanding of the lichen-inhabiting fungi that are achieved by multiphasic approaches (culturing, microscopy, and sequencing). The lichen mycobiome comprises a more or less specific pool of species that can develop symptoms on their hosts, a generalist environmental pool, and a pool of transient species. Typically, the fungal classes Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Tremellomycetes predominate the associated fungal communities. While symptomatic lichenicolous fungi belong to lichen-forming lineages, many of the other fungi that are found have close relatives that are known from different ecological niches, including both plant and animal pathogens, and rock colonizers. A significant fraction of yet unnamed melanized (‘black’) fungi belong to the classes Chaethothyriomycetes and Dothideomycetes. These lineages tolerate the stressful conditions and harsh environments that affect their hosts, and therefore are interpreted as extremotolerant fungi. Some of these taxa can also form lichen-like associations with the algae of the lichen system when they are enforced to symbiosis by co-culturing assays.","3","Journal","re","Review","100","2","Cultures | Metabarcoding | Mycobiome | Photobionts | Phylogenetics | Symbiosis | Systematics","27202","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","447","8","2",NA,"15",NA,NA,2018

This information is important for developing effective control strategies. Here, we examine DNA-based techniques to determine food plants of D. suzukii. Adult flies were fed with raspberries (Rubus idaeus) and allowed to digest up to 72 h after feeding. Raspberry DNA was detected by diagnostic PCR for up to 48 h post-feeding with a significant negative effect of time on DNA detection success but no significant differences between male and female flies in detection probabilities. As D. suzukii walks on plants, its body surface can get contaminated with DNA. With a bleaching experiment, we succeeded to remove contaminating external plant DNA, while the DNA in the gut content stayed unaffected. Finally, field-collected flies were subjected to a next-generation sequencing approach, demonstrating that plant DNA from different host plants can be efficiently detected in both bleached and non-bleached specimens. In order to safeguard against erroneous host plant detections, we recommend bleaching flies before they are subjected to DNA extraction. The current findings encourage the use of DNA-based gut content analysis in D. suzukii to obtain a better understanding of its feeding ecology which is a prerequisite for developing successful control strategies.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Chloroplast DNA | Diet metabarcoding | Feeding experiment | High-throughput sequencing | Molecular gut content analysis | NGS | Spotted Wing Drosophila","25697","CZ","Ontario Ministry of Food and Agriculture","0","FALSE","448","91","3",NA,NA,"OMAF",NA,2018

Human activity might contribute to reduced partitioning of niche space by carnivores that consume similar resources, both by promoting tolerant species while also altering behavior of species (e.g. activity patterns). We investigated the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on habitat and dietary niche breadth and overlap among competing carnivores, and explored if altered resource partitioning could be explained by human-induced activity shifts. To describe the diets of coyotes, bobcat, and gray foxes, we designed a citizen science program to collect carnivore scat samples in low- (‘wildland’) and high- (‘interface’) human-use open space preserves, and obtained diet estimates using a DNA metabarcoding approach. Habitat use was determined at scat locations. We found that coyotes expanded habitat and dietary niche breadth in interface preserves, whereas bobcats and foxes narrowed both niche breadth measures. High human use was related to increased dietary niche overlap among all mesocarnivore pairs, increased coyote habitat overlap with bobcats and foxes, and a small reduction in habitat overlap between bobcats and foxes. The strongest increase in diet overlap was among coyotes and foxes, which was smaller in magnitude than their habitat overlap increase. Finally, coyote scats were more likely to contain nocturnal prey in interface preserves, whereas foxes appeared to reduce consumption of nocturnal prey.

The microbial diversity associated with diffuse venting deep-sea hydrothermal deposits is tightly coupled to the geochemistry of the hydrothermal fluids. Previous 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (metabarcoding) of marine iron-hydroxide deposits along the Arctic Mid Ocean Ridge, revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities associated with these deposits (Storesund and Øvreås in Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 104:569–584, 2013). One of the most abundant and diverse phyla detected was the enigmatic Planctomycetes. Here we report on the comparative analyses of the diversity and distribution patterns of Planctomycetes associated with metalliferous deposits from two diffuse-flow hydrothermal vent fields (Mariner and Vai Lili) from the Valu Fa Ridge in the Southwestern Pacific. Metabarcoding of 16S rRNA genes showed that the major prokaryotic phyla were Proteobacteria (51–73% of all 16S rRNA gene reads), Epsilonbacteraeota (0.5–19%), Bacteriodetes (5–17%), Planctomycetes (0.4–11%), Candidatus Latescibacteria (0–5%) and Marine Benthic Group E (Hydrothermarchaeota) (0–5%). The two different sampling sites differed considerably in overall community composition.

Hence, assessing ecosystem health and effects of agricultural management would benefit from understanding and monitoring pollination networks, which involves identifications of pollinators and pollinated plants. Classic approaches of morphology-based identification of plants and pollinators can be time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly, and require highly specialized taxonomic expertise. In comparison, DNA barcoding and high-throughput sequencing technologies can provide efficient and accurate identifications of plants and their pollinators, which may facilitate construction of pollination networks. Here we propose using sequencing technologies with a PCR-free genome-skimming work frame, using “super DNA barcode” as a new method to assess plant-pollinator networks. We expect this technique to improve resolution and accuracy of taxonomic identification to help gain quantitative information for bulk samples of pollinators or pollens. Al-though there are technical challenges to be resolved, the robustness of the new methodology has been validated in relevant biodiversity studies, suggesting promise in constructing pollination networks.","1","Journal","re","Review","100","3","Chloroplast | Metabarcoding | Metagenome | Mitochondria | PCR-free | Pollen | Quantify","21100826276","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","457","26","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Background: Many trichostrongylid nematode species are reported to infect bison, some of which are major causes of disase and production loss in North American bison herds. However, there is little information on the species distribution and relative abundance of these parasites in either commercial or conservation herds. This is largely because trichostrongylid nematode species cannot be distinguished by visual microscopic examination of eggs present in feces. Consequently, we have applied ITS2 rDNA nemabiome metabarcoding to describe the trichostrongyle parasite species diversity in 58 bison production groups derived from 38 commercial North American plains bison (Bison bison bison) herds from across western Canada, and two bison conservation herds located in Elk Island National Park (EINP) [plains bison and wood bison (Bison bison athabascae)] and one in Grasslands National Park (GNP) (plains bison). Results: We report much higher infection intensities and parasite species diversity in commercial bison herds than previously reported in beef cattle herds grazing similar latitudes. Predominant trichostrongyle parasite species in western Canadian commercial bison herds are those commonly associated with Canadian cattle, with Ostertagia ostertagi being the most abundant followed by Cooperia oncophora. Combined with high fecal egg counts in many herds, this is consistent with significant clinical and production-limiting gastrointestinal parasitism in western Canadian bison herds. However, Haemonchus placei was the most abundant species in five of the production groups. This is both surprising and important, as this highly pathogenic blood-feeding parasite has not been reported at such abundance, in any livestock species, at such northerly latitudes. The presence of Trichostrongylus axei as the most abundant parasite in four herds is also unusual, relative to cattle.

Most notably, Orloffia bisonis was the predominant species in the wood bison herd despite being found at only low levels in all other herds surveyed.

Echinacea products are among the top-selling herbal products in Europe and the United States with indications for a broad range of ailments. The increased use of Echinacea species has led to concerns about adulterated products resulting from challenges in morphology-based identification, due to overlapping morphological variation, frequent hybridization between species, and deliberate adulteration. Purpose: This study addressed the need for a novel analytical strategy in the authentication of herbal products. Methods: A combination of high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) and DNA metabarcoding was employed. Fifty-three Echinacea herbal products marketed across Europe were tested to evaluate the accuracy of these methods in plant identification and their potential for detecting substitutes, adulterants and other unreported plant constituents. Results: HPTLC provides high resolution in the detection of Echinacea phytochemical target compounds, but does not offer information on the other species within the product. Alternatively, we showed that the limitation of HPTLC in detecting non-targeted species can be overcome by the complementary use of DNA metabarcoding. Using DNA metabarcoding, Echinacea species were detected in 34 out of the 38 retained products (89%), but with a lack of discriminatory resolution at the species level due to the low level of molecular divergence within the Echinacea genus. All of the tested herbal products showed considerable discrepancies between ingredients listed on the label and the ones detected using DNA metabarcoding, registering an overall ingredient fidelity of only 43%. Conclusion: The results confirm that DNA metabarcoding can be used to test for the presence of Echinacea species and simultaneously to detect other species present in even highly processed and multi-ingredient herbal products.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Authentication | DNA metabarcoding | Echinacea | Herbal pharmacovigilance | Herbal products | HPTLC","17067","2SEE/2014","European Environment Agency","0","FALSE","459","44",NA,"29895490",NA,NA,"S094471131830093X",2018

Intestinal health is determined by host (immunity, mucosal barrier), nutritional, microbial and environmental factors. Deficiencies in intestinal health are associated with shifts in the composition of the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis), leakage of the mucosal barrier and/or inflammation. Since the ban on growth promoting antimicrobials in animal feed, these dysbiosis-related problems have become a major issue, especially in intensive animal farming. The economical and animal welfare consequences are considerable. Consequently, there is a need for continuous monitoring of the intestinal health status, particularly in intensively reared animals, where the intestinal function is often pushed to the limit. In the current review, the recent advances in the field of intestinal health biomarkers, both in human and veterinary medicine are discussed, trying to identify present and future markers of intestinal health in poultry. The most promising new biomarkers will be stable molecules ending up in the feces and litter that can be quantified, preferably using rapid and simple pen-side tests. It is unlikely, however, that a single biomarker will be sufficient to follow up all aspects of intestinal health. Combinations of multiple biomarkers and/or metabarcoding, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, metaproteomic and metabolomic approaches will be the way to go in the future. Candidate biomarkers currently are being investigated by many research groups, but the validation will be a major challenge, due to the complexity of intestinal health in the field.","6","Journal","re","Review","100","7",NA,"19555","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","460","49","1","29739469","43",NA,NA,2018

However, the rapid accumulation of barcoding data has created some difficulties: for instance, global enquiries to a large reference library can take a very long time. We here devise a two-step searching strategy to speed identification procedures of such queries. This firstly uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm to narrow the searching scope to genus level and then determines the corresponding species using minimum genetic distance. Moreover, using a fuzzy membership function, our approach also estimates the credibility of assignment results for each query. To perform this task, we developed a new software pipeline, FuzzyID2, using Python and C++. Performance of the new method was assessed using eight empirical data sets ranging from 70 to 234,535 barcodes. Five data sets (four animal, one plant) deployed the conventional barcode approach, one used metabarcodes, and two were eDNA-based. The results showed mean accuracies of generic and species identification of 98.60% (with a minimum of 95.00% and a maximum of 100.00%) and 94.17% (with a range of 84.40%–100.00%), respectively. Tests with simulated NGS sequences based on realistic eDNA and metabarcode data demonstrated that FuzzyID2 achieved a significantly higher identification success rate than the commonly used Blast method, and the TIPP method tends to find many fewer species than either FuzztID2 or Blast. Furthermore, data sets with tens of thousands of barcodes need only a few seconds for each query assignment using FuzzyID2. Our approach provides an efficient and accurate species identification protocol for biodiversity-related projects with large DNA sequence data sets.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","DNA barcoding | eDNA | fuzzy membership function | hidden Markov models | high-throughput sequencing (HTS) | metabarcoding | plant barcodes","11700154306","IRT-17R75","National Natural Science Foundation of China","0","FALSE","461","18","3","29154499",NA,NA,NA,2018

Riparian habitats are characterized by substantial flows of emergent aquatic insects that cross the stream-forest interface and provide an important source of prey for insectivorous birds. The increased availability of prey arising from aquatic subsidies attracts high densities of Neotropical migratory songbirds that are thought to exploit emergent aquatic insects as a nestling food resource; however, the prey preferences and diets of birds in these communities are only broadly understood. In this study, we utilized DNA metabarcoding to investigate the extent to which three syntopic species of migratory songbirds—Acadian Flycatcher, Louisiana Waterthrush, and Wood Thrush—breeding in Appalachian riparian habitats (Pennsylvania, USA) exploit and partition aquatic prey subsidies as a nestling food resource. Despite substantial differences in adult foraging strategies, nearly every nestling in this study consumed aquatic taxa, suggesting that aquatic subsidies are an important prey resource for Neotropical migrants nesting in riparian habitats. While our results revealed significant interspecific dietary niche divergence, the diets of Acadian Flycatcher and Wood Thrush nestlings were strikingly similar and exhibited significantly more overlap than expected. These results suggest that the dietary niches of Neotropical migrants with divergent foraging strategies may converge due to the opportunistic provisioning of non-limiting prey resources in riparian habitats. In addition to providing the first application of DNA metabarcoding to investigate diet in a community of Neotropical migrants, this study emphasizes the importance of aquatic subsidies in supporting breeding songbirds and improves our understanding of how anthropogenic disturbances to riparian habitats may negatively impact long-term avian conservation.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Acadian flycatcher | Diet | Louisiana waterthrush | Resource subsidies | Wood thrush","12925","DEB-1349870","American Ornithological Society","0","FALSE","464","187","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Biases may occur throughout the whole experiment, from fieldwork to biostatistics, resulting in the detection of false negatives, false positives or low taxonomic resolution. We detail a rigorous metabarcoding approach based on a short COI minibarcode and two-step PCR protocol enabling the “all at once” taxonomic identification of bats and their arthropod prey for several hundreds of samples. Our study includes faecal pellets collected in France from 357 bats representing 16 species, as well as insect mock communities that mimic bat meals of known composition, negative and positive controls. All samples were analysed using three replicates. We compare the efficiency of DNA extraction methods, and we evaluate the effectiveness of our protocol using identification success, taxonomic resolution, sensitivity and amplification biases. Our parallel identification strategy of predators and prey reduces the risk of mis-assigning prey to wrong predators and decreases the number of molecular steps. Controls and replicates enable to filter the data and limit the risk of false positives, hence guaranteeing high confidence results for both prey occurrence and bat species identification. We validate 551 COI variants from arthropod including 18 orders, 117 family, 282 genus and 290 species.

In marine ecosystems, plankton surveys using the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) have characterized biodiversity along transects covering millions of kilometres with time-series spanning decades. We investigated the potential for use of metabarcoding in CPR surveys. Samples (n = 53) were collected in two Southern Ocean transects and metazoans identified using standard microscopic methods and by high-throughput sequencing of a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I marker. DNA increased the number of metazoan species identified and provided high-resolution taxonomy of groups problematic in conventional surveys (e.g., larval echinoderms and hydrozoans). Metabarcoding also generally produced more detections than microscopy, but this sensitivity may make cross-contamination during sampling a problem. In some samples, the prevalence of DNA from large plankton such as krill masked the presence of smaller species. We investigated adding a fixed amount of exogenous DNA to samples as an internal control to allow determination of relative plankton biomass. Overall, the metabarcoding data represent a substantial shift in perspective, making direct integration into current long-term time-series challenging. We discuss a number of hurdles that exist for progressing DNA metabarcoding from the current snapshot studies to the requirements of a long-term monitoring programme.

Spore samplers are widely used in pathogen surveillance but not so much for monitoring the composition of aeromycobiota. In Canada, a nationwide spore-sampling network (AeroNet) was established as a pilot project to assess fungal community composition in air and rain samples collected using three different spore samplers in the summers of 2010 and 2011. Metabarcodes of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) were exhaustively characterized for three of the network sites, in British Columbia (BC), Québec (QC), and Prince Edward Island (PEI), to compare performance of the samplers. Sampler type accounted for ca. 20% of the total explainable variance in aeromycobiota compositional heterogeneity, with air samplers recovering more Ascomycota and rain samplers recovering more Basidiomycota. Spore samplers showed different abilities to collect 27 fungal genera that are plant pathogens. For instance, Cladosporium spp., Drechslera spp., and Entyloma spp. were collected mainly by air samplers, while Fusarium spp., Microdochium spp., and Ustilago spp. were recovered more frequently with rain samplers. The diversity and abundance of some fungi were significantly affected by sampling location and time (e.g., Alternaria and Bipolaris) and weather conditions (e.g., Mycocentrospora and Leptosphaeria), and depended on using ITS1 or ITS2 as the barcoding region (e.g., Epicoccum and Botrytis). The observation that Canada's aeromycobiota diversity correlates with cooler, wetter conditions and northward wind requires support from more long-term data sets. Our vision of the AeroNet network, combined with highthroughput sequencing (HTS) and well-designed sampling strategies, may contribute significantly to a national biovigilance network for protecting plants of agricultural and economic importance in Canada.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Air- and rain-borne fungi | High-throughput sequencing | HTS | Metabarcodes | Plant fungal pathogens | Spore sampler","19618","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","468","84","9",NA,"e02601-17",NA,NA,2018

Flies, which are ubiquitous and very abundant in most cities, may also be used to detect wildlife in urban areas. In urban ecosystems, however, overwhelming quantities of domestic mammal DNA could completely mask the presence of wild mammal DNA. To test whether urban wild mammals can be detected using fly iDNA, we performed DNA metabarcoding of pools of flies captured in Berlin, Germany, using three combinations of blocking primers. Our results show that domestic animal sequences are, as expected, very dominant in urban environments. Nevertheless, wild mammal sequences can often be retrieved, although they usually only represent a minor fraction of the sequence reads. Fly iDNA metabarcoding is therefore a viable approach for quick scans of urban wildlife diversity.

Molecular gut-content analysis has revolutionized the study of food webs and feeding interactions, allowing the detection of prey DNA within the gut of many organisms. However, successful prey detection is a challenging procedure in which many factors affect every step, starting from the DNA extraction process. Spiders are liquid feeders with branched gut diver-ticula extending into their legs and throughout the prosoma, thus digestion takes places in different parts of the body and simple gut dissection is not possible. In this study, we investigated differences in prey detectability in DNA extracts from different parts of the spider´s body: legs, prosoma and opisthosoma, using prey-specific PCR and metabarcoding approaches. We performed feeding trials with the woodlouse hunter spider Dysdera verneaui Simon, 1883 (Dysderidae) to estimate the time at which prey DNA is detectable within the predator after feeding. Although we found that all parts of the spider body are suitable for gut-content analysis when using prey-specific PCR approach, results based on metabarcoding suggested the opisthosoma is optimal for detection of predation in spiders because it contained the highest concentration of prey DNA for longer post feeding periods. Other spiders may show different results compared to D. verneaui, but given similarities in the physiology and digestion in different families, it is reasonable to assume this to be common across species and this approach having broad utility across spiders.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"10600153309","CGL2012-36863","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad","1","TRUE","472","13","5","29847544","e0196589","MINECO",NA,2018

Tintinnid ciliates are suitable models to study the diversity and biogeography of microbial plankton. In addition to morphological data accumulated over two centuries, most known families and common genera have been linked to DNA sequences in relatively recent barcoding efforts. This backbone of morphologically identified sequences is used here to classify environmental sequences in order to study global and local spatial trends. Analyses of tintinnid SSU rDNA data collected worldwide (about 900 sequences available in NCBI GenBank) and in the northwest Atlantic Ocean (about 500,000 sequences obtained by metabarcoding) support distribution patterns related to salinity, bathymetry and climate/ latitude. In addition to the marine-freshwater dichotomy and a pattern of coastal-only taxa known for tintinnids, there is a global trend of phylotypes restricted to brackish or open waters. Local alpha and beta diversity analyses show that assemblage differences among estuarine, coastal and open waters are not significant regarding richness, but are significant in terms of phylogenetic composition. We also confirm spatial restriction of boreal and austral taxa, and stress that cosmopolitanism cannot be assessed by molecular methods that lump data from potentially endemic and commonly widespread taxa. Heterogeneous diversity, biogeography and phylogenetic resolution within and among tintinnid lineages raise questions about the processes that promote their diversification and determine their spatial distributions.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","brackish-water species | cosmopolitanism | endemism | protist | spatial distribution","29635","OCE1435515","National Science Foundation","1","TRUE","473","40","3",NA,NA,"UCONN",NA,2018

This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. Microbial ecology has been profoundly advanced by the ability to profile complex microbial communities by sequencing of marker genes amplified from environmental samples. However, inclusion of appropriate controls is vital to revealing the limitations and biases of this technique. “Mock community” samples, in which the composition and relative abundances of community members are known, are particularly valuable for guiding library preparation and data processing decisions. I generated a set of three mock communities using 19 different fungal taxa and demonstrate their utility by contrasting amplicon sequencing data obtained for the same communities under modifications to PCR conditions during library preparation. Increasing the number of PCR cycles elevated rates of chimera formation, and of errors in the final data set. Extension time during PCR had little impact on chimera formation, error rate or observed community structure. Polymerase fidelity impacted error rates significantly. Despite a high error rate, a master mix optimized to minimize amplification bias yielded profiles that were most similar to the true community structure. Bias against particular taxa differed among ITS1 vs. ITS2 loci. Preclustering nearly identical reads substantially reduced error rates, but did not improve similarity to the expected community structure. Inaccuracies in amplicon sequence-based estimates of fungal community structure were associated with amplification bias and size selection processes, as well as variable culling rates among reads from different taxa. In some cases, the numerically dominant taxon was completely absent from final data sets, highlighting the need for further methodological improvements to avoid biased observations of community profiles.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","1","amplicon sequencing | internal transcribed spacer (ITS) | metabarcoding | MiSeq | mock community","11700154306","undefined","American Radium Society","0","FALSE","476","18","3","29389073",NA,NA,NA,2018

This process is daunting when based on morphology, and disadvantageous if performed using molecular methods that destroy vouchers (e.g., metabarcoding). An alternative is barcoding every specimen in a bulk sample and then presorting the specimens using DNA barcodes, thus mitigating downstream morphological work on presorted units. Such a “reverse workflow” is too expensive using Sanger sequencing, but we here demonstrate that is feasible with an next-generation sequencing (NGS) barcoding pipeline that allows for cost-effective high-throughput generation of short specimen-specific barcodes (313 bp of COI; laboratory cost <$0.50 per specimen) through next-generation sequencing of tagged amplicons. We applied our approach to a large sample of tropical ants, obtaining barcodes for 3,290 of 4,032 specimens (82%). NGS barcodes and their corresponding specimens were then sorted into molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) based on objective clustering and Automated Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD). High diversity of 88–90 mOTUs (4% clustering) was found and morphologically validated based on preserved vouchers. The mOTUs were overwhelmingly in agreement with morphospecies (match ratio 0.95 at 4% clustering). Because of lack of coverage in existing barcode databases, only 18 could be accurately identified to named species, but our study yielded new barcodes for 48 species, including 28 that are potentially new to science. With its low cost and technical simplicity, the NGS barcoding pipeline can be implemented by a large range of laboratories. It accelerates invertebrate species discovery, facilitates downstream taxonomic work, helps with building comprehensive barcode databases and yields precise abundance information.","9","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","community ecology | DNA barcoding | insects | invertebrates | systematics","11700154306","R-154-000-A22-112","Ministry of Education - Singapore","0","FALSE","477","18","3","29314756",NA,NA,NA,2018

Reef-building corals maintain a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium, and this symbiosis is vital for the survival of the coral holobiont. Symbiodinium community composition within the coral host has been shown to influence a coral’s ability to resist and recover from stress. A multitude of stressors including ocean warming, ocean acidification, and eutrophication have been linked to global scale decline in coral health and cover in recent decades. Three distinct thermal regimes (highTP, modTP, and lowTP) following an inshore-offshore gradient of declining average temperatures and thermal variation were identified on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS). Quantitative metabarcoding of the ITS-2 locus was employed to investigate differences and similarities in Symbiodinium genetic diversity of the Caribbean corals Siderastrea siderea, S. radians, and Pseudodiploria strigosa between the three thermal regimes. A total of ten Symbiodinium lineages were identified across the three coral host species. S. siderea was associated with distinct Symbiodinium communities; however, Symbiodinium communities of its congener, S. radians and P. strigosa, were more similar to one another. Thermal regime played a role in defining Symbiodinium communities in S. siderea but not S. radians or P. strigosa. Against expectations, Symbiodinium trenchii, a symbiont known to confer thermal tolerance, was dominant only in S. siderea at one sampled offshore site and was rare inshore, suggesting that coral thermal tolerance in more thermally variable inshore habitats is achieved through alternative mechanisms. Overall, thermal parameters alone were likely not the only primary drivers of Symbiodinium community composition, suggesting that environmental variables unrelated to temperature (i.e., light availability or nutrients) may play key roles in structuring coral-algal communities in Belize and that the relative importance of these environmental variables may vary by coral host species.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Coral | Environmental variability | Marine science | Symbiodinium | Symbiosis","20266","15802-1","Rufford Foundation","0","FALSE","478","75","4","29098358",NA,NA,NA,2018

The increasing number and duration of inundations is reported to be a consequence of climate change and may severely compromise non-adapted macroorganisms. The effect of flooding events on terrestrial and aquatic microbial communities is, however, less well understood. They may respond to the changed abiotic properties of their native habitat, and the native community may change due to the introduction of alien species. We designed an experiment to investigate the effect of five different flooding durations on the terrestrial and aquatic communities of eukaryotic microorganism, using the AquaFlow mesocosms. With amplicon sequencing of the small subunit (SSU) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA gene regions, we analyzed community compositions directly before and after flooding. Subsequently, they were monitored for another 28 days, to determine the sustainability of community changes. Our results revealed a temporary increase in similarity between terrestrial and aquatic communities according to OTU composition (operational taxonomic unit, serves as a proxy for species). Increased similarity was mainly caused by the transmission of OTUs from water to soil. A minority of these were able to persist in soil until the end of the experiment. By contrast, the vast majority of soil OTUs was not transmitted to water. Flooding duration affected the community structure (abundance) more than composition (occurrence). Terrestrial communities responded immediately to flooding and the flooding duration influenced the community changes. Independent from flooding duration, all terrestrial communities recovered largely after flooding, indicating a remarkable resilience to the applied disturbances. Aquatic communities responded immediately to the applied inundations too. At the end of the experiment, they grouped according to the applied flooding duration and the amount of ammonium and chloride that leached from the soil. This indicates a sustained long-term response of the aquatic communities to flooding events.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Aquatic eukaryotes | Flooding duration | High-throughput sequencing | Mesocosm experiment | Metabarcoding | Terrestrial eukaryotes","20266","Pr-2013-0036","Stiftung Mercator Schweiz","0","FALSE","479","75","4","29026984",NA,NA,NA,2018

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy, together with confocal laser scanning microscopy, has increased the amount of external and internal morphological information, improving the quantity and quality of species descriptions, as well as deepening our understanding of the evolutionary adaptations of meiofauna. In ecology, the characterization of molecules such as stable isotopes and fatty acids have permitted us to infer trophic niches of meiofauna species, enhancing our understanding of their functional role in the ecosystem. In parallel, advances in DNA sequencing techniques have allowed us to quantify with much higher accuracy the phylogenetic position of meiofaunal species. We here review the main biodiversity shortfalls in the studies of meiofauna, discussing how such shortfalls could be addressed, especially by merging different approaches. Important steps towards such interdisciplinary approach are to promote data sharing, to explore new technologies that combine disciplines, and to base studies on a clear theoretical framework.

In High Arctic Greenland, Arctic hare and rock ptarmigan often forage in muskox feeding craters. We therefore hypothesized that due to limited availability of forage, the dietary niches of these resident herbivores overlap considerably, and that the overlap increases as winter progresses. To test this, we analyzed fecal samples collected in early and late winter. We used molecular analysis to identify the plant taxa consumed, and stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen to quantify the dietary niche breadth and dietary overlap. The plant taxa found indicated only limited dietary differentiation between the herbivores. As expected, dietary niches exhibited a strong contraction from early to late winter, especially for rock ptarmigan. This may indicate increasing reliance on particular plant resources as winter progresses. In early winter, the diet of rock ptarmigan overlapped slightly with that of muskox and Arctic hare. Contrary to our expectations, no inter-specific dietary niche overlap was observed in late winter. This overall pattern was specifically revealed by combined analysis of molecular data and stable isotope contents. Hence, despite foraging in the same areas and generally feeding on the same plant taxa, the quantitative dietary overlap between the three herbivores was limited. This may be attributable to species-specific consumption rates of plant taxa. Yet, Arctic hare and rock ptarmigan may benefit from muskox opening up the snow pack, thereby allowing them to access the plants.","4","Journal","undefined",NA,"100","5","Competition | Greenland | Metabarcoding | Stable isotopes | Tundra","12925","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","481",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

As the conventional methods are difficult and time-consuming to detect processed products or identify animal species with similar morphology, developing novel authentication methods for animal-based traditional medicine represents an urgent need. During the last decade, DNA barcoding offers an accurate and efficient strategy that can identify existing species and discover unknown species via analysis of sequence variation in a standardized region of DNA. Recent studies have shown that DNA barcoding as well as minibarcoding and metabarcoding is capable of identifying animal species and discriminating the authentics from the adulterants in various types of traditional medicines, including raw materials, processed products, and complex preparations. These techniques can also be used to detect the unlabelled and threatened animal species in traditional medicine.

Fungi are the driving force for ecosystem processes such as decomposition and carbon sequestration in terrestrial habitats, and are strongly influenced by interactions with invertebrates. Yet, interactions in detritivore communities have rarely been considered froma network perspective. In the present study, we analyse the interaction networks between three functional guilds of fungi and insects sampled from dead wood. Using DNA metabarcoding to identify fungi, we reveal a diversity of interactions differing in specificity in the detritivore networks, involving three guilds of fungi. Plant pathogenic fungi were relatively unspecialized in their interactions with insects inhabiting dead wood, while interactions between the insects and wood-decay fungi exhibited the highest degree of specialization, which was similar to estimates for animal-mediated seed dispersal networks in previous studies. The low degree of specialization for insect symbiont fungi was unexpected. In general, the pooled insect-fungus networks were significantly more specialized, more modular and less nested than randomized networks. Thus, the detritivore networks had an unusual anti-nested structure. Future studies might corroborate whether this is a common aspect of networks based on interactions with fungi, possibly owing to their often intense competition for substrate.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Dead wood | Nestedness | Plant pathogenic fungi | Spore dispersal | Symbiont fungi | Weighted networks","130030","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","483","285","1876","29618548","20172833",NA,NA,2018

Blue whales are little studied, face significant anthropogenic threats and within the Northern Indian Ocean, have a restricted range, making them an archetype for conservation needs of megafauna around the world. We studied feeding behavior of blue whales using dietary DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples. While globally blue whale populations feed predominantly on Euphausiidae, 87% of prey DNA amplicons extracted from fecal samples from this population were sergestid shrimp, demonstrating that blue whales can locate and feed on dense swarms of other types of prey when they occur. Within the Indian Ocean sergestids are present within the top 300 m, which correlates with the deep scattering layer observed by hydroacoustics. Studies suggest that this requirement to dive deeper in search of prey likely explains the prevalence of fluke up diving within this population of blue whales relative to other parts of the globe. Furthermore, this study revealed the presence of acanthocephalan endoparasites within the stomach and intestines of the Northern Indian Ocean blue whales.

Interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria play important roles in shaping the microenvironment surrounding these organisms and in turn influence global biogeochemical cycles. This microenvironment, known as the phycosphere, is presumed to shape the bacterial diversity around phytoplankton and thus stimulate a diverse array of interactions between both groups. Although many studies have attempted to characterize bacterial communities that associate and interact with phytoplankton, bias in bacterial cultivation and consistency and persistence of bacterial communities across phytoplankton isolates likely impede the understanding of these microbial associations. Here, we isolate four strains of the diatom Asterionellopsis glacialis and three strains of the diatom Nitzschia longissima and show through metabarcoding of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene that though each species possesses a unique bacterial community, the bacterial composition across strains from the same species are highly conserved at the genus level. Cultivation of all seven strains in the laboratory for longer than 1 year resulted in only small changes to the bacterial composition, suggesting that despite strong pressures from laboratory culturing conditions associations between these diatoms and their bacterial communities are robust. Specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the Roseobacter-clade appear to be conserved across all strains and time, suggesting their importance to diatoms. In addition, we isolate a range of cultivable bacteria from one of these cultures, A. glacialis strain A3, including several strains of Shimia marina and Nautella sp. that appear closely related to OTUs conserved across all strains and times. Coculturing of A3 with some of its cultivable bacteria as well as other diatom-associated bacteria shows a wide range of responses that include enhancing diatom growth.

Disease-suppressive soils are soils in which specific soil-borne plant pathogens cause only limited disease although the pathogen and susceptible host plants are both present. Suppressiveness is in most cases of microbial origin. We conducted a comparative metabarcoding analysis of the taxonomic diversity of fungal and bacterial communities from suppressive and non-suppressive (conducive) soils as regards Fusarium wilts sampled from the Châteaurenard region (France). Bioassays based on Fusarium wilt of flax confirmed that disease incidence was significantly lower in the suppressive soil than in the conducive soil. Furthermore, we succeeded in partly transferring Fusarium wilt-suppressiveness to the conducive soil by mixing 10% (w/w) of the suppressive soil into the conducive soil. Fungal diversity differed significantly between the suppressive and conducive soils. Among dominant fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated to known genera, 17 OTUs were detected exclusively in the suppressive soil. These OTUs were assigned to the Acremonium, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Clonostachys, Fusarium, Ceratobasidium, Mortierella, Penicillium, Scytalidium, and Verticillium genera. Additionally, the relative abundance of specific members of the bacterial community was significantly higher in the suppressive and mixed soils than in the conducive soil. OTUs found more abundant in Fusarium wilt-suppressive soils were affiliated to the bacterial genera Adhaeribacter, Massilia, Microvirga, Rhizobium, Rhizobacter, Arthrobacter, Amycolatopsis, Rubrobacter, Paenibacillus, Stenotrophomonas, and Geobacter. Several of the fungal and bacterial genera detected exclusively or more abundantly in the Fusarium wilt-suppressive soil included genera known for their activity against F. oxysporum. Overall, this study supports the potential role of known fungal and bacterial genera in Fusarium wilt suppressive soils from Châteaurenard and pinpoints new bacterial and fungal genera for their putative role in Fusarium wilt suppressiveness.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","454 pyrosequencing | Bacterial community | Biocontrol agent | Diversity | Fungal community | Metabarcoding","21100226442","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","486","9","APR",NA,"568",NA,NA,2018

Methods in Ecology and Evolution © 2017 British Ecological Society In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in developing environmental DNA metabarcoding. However, its ability to quantify species relative abundance remains uncertain, limiting its application for biomonitoring. In diatoms, although the rbcL gene appears to be a suitable barcode for diatoms, providing relevant qualitative data to describe taxonomic composition, improvement of species quantification is still required. Here, we hypothesized that rbcL copy number is correlated with diatom cell biovolume (as previously described for the 18S gene) and that a correction factor (CF) based on cell biovolume should be applied to improve taxa quantification. We carried out a laboratory experiment using pure cultures of eight diatom species with contrasted cell biovolumes in order to (1) verify the relationship between rbcL copy numbers (estimated by qPCR) and diatom cell biovolumes and (2) define a potential CF. In order to evaluate CF efficiency, five mock communities were created by mixing different amounts of DNA from the eight species, and were sequenced using HTS and targeting the same rbcL barcode. As expected, the correction of DNA reads proportions by the CF improved the congruence between morphological and molecular inventories. Final validation of the CF was obtained on environmental samples (metabarcoding data from 80 benthic biofilms) for which the application of CF allowed differences between molecular and morphological water quality indices to be reduced by 47%. Overall, our results highlight the usefulness of applying a CF factor, which is effective in reducing over-estimation of high biovolume species, correcting quantitative biases in diatom metabarcoding studies and improving final water quality assessment.","9","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","benthic diatom | biovolume correction factor | freshwater ecosystems | gene copy number variation | quantitative metabarcoding","21100217611","CA 15219",NA,"0","FALSE","488","9","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Quality control of drugs consists of identifying the raw material to avoid unwanted admixtures or exchange of material as well as looking for abiotic and biotic contaminations. So far, identity and microbial contamination are analyzed by separate processes and separate methods. Species identification by their DNA (DNA barcoding) has the potential to supplement existing methods of identification. The introduction of next-generation sequencing methods offers completely new approaches like the identification of whole communities in one analysis, termed DNA metabarcoding. Here we present a next-generation sequencing assessment to identify plants and fungi of two commercial sage samples (Salvia officinalis) using the standard DNA barcoding region internal transcribed spacer consisting of internal transcribed spacer 1 and internal transcribed spacer 2, respectively. The main species in both samples was identified as S. officinalis. The spectrum of accompanying plant and fungal species, however, was completely different between the samples. Additionally, the composition between internal transcribed spacer 1 and internal transcribed spacer 2 within the samples was different and demonstrated the influence of primer selection and therefore the need for harmonization. This next-generation sequencing approach does not result in quantitative species composition but gives deeper insight into the composition of additional species. Therefore, it would allow for a better knowledge-based risk assessment than any other method available.

SUMMARY Despite metabarcoding being widely used to analyse bacterial community composition, its application in parasitological research remains limited. What interest there has been has focused on previously intractable research settings where traditional methods are inappropriate, for example, in longitudinal studies and studies involving endangered species. In settings such as these, non-invasive sampling combined with metabarcoding can provide a fast and accurate assessment of component communities. In this paper we review the use of metabarcoding in the study of helminth communities in wild mammals, outlining the necessary procedures from sample collection to statistical analysis. We highlight the limitations of the metabarcoding approach and speculate on what type of parasitological study would benefit from such methods in the future.","3","Journal","re","Review","100","2","cestodes | community ecology | genetic identification | high-throughtput sequencing | Key wordsmammals | nematodes","22993","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","491","145","5","28534454",NA,NA,"S0031182017000610",2018

Metabarcoding of lake sediments have been shown to reveal current and past biodiversity, but little is known about the degree to which taxa growing in the vegetation are represented in environmental DNA (eDNA) records. We analysed composition of lake and catchment vegetation and vascular plant eDNA at 11 lakes in northern Norway. Out of 489 records of taxa growing within 2 m from the lake shore, 17–49% (mean 31%) of the identifiable taxa recorded were detected with eDNA. Of the 217 eDNA records of 47 plant taxa in the 11 lakes, 73% and 12% matched taxa recorded in vegetation surveys within 2 m and up to about 50 m away from the lakeshore, respectively, whereas 16% were not recorded in the vegetation surveys of the same lake. The latter include taxa likely overlooked in the vegetation surveys or growing outside the survey area. The percentages detected were 61, 47, 25, and 15 for dominant, common, scattered, and rare taxa, respectively. Similar numbers for aquatic plants were 88, 88, 33 and 62%, respectively. Detection rate and taxonomic resolution varied among plant families and functional groups with good detection of e.g. Ericaceae, Roseaceae, deciduous trees, ferns, club mosses and aquatics. The representation of terrestrial taxa in eDNA depends on both their distance from the sampling site and their abundance and is sufficient for recording vegetation types. For aquatic vegetation, eDNA may be comparable with, or even superior to, in-lake vegetation surveys and may therefore be used as an tool for biomonitoring. For reconstruction of terrestrial vegetation, technical improvements and more intensive sampling is needed to detect a higher proportion of rare taxa although DNA of some taxa may never reach the lake sediments due to taphonomical constrains. Nevertheless, eDNA performs similar to conventional methods of pollen and macrofossil analyses and may therefore be an important tool for reconstruction of past vegetation.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"10600153309","213692/F20","Norges Forskningsråd","1","TRUE","492","13","4","29664954","e0195403",NA,NA,2018

Sea turtles are distributed in tropical and subtropical seas worldwide. They play several ecological roles and are considered important indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. Studying epibiotic diatoms living on turtle shells suggestively has great potential in the study of turtle behavior because diatoms are always there. However, diatom identification at the species level is time consuming, requires well-trained specialists, and there is a high probability of finding new taxa growing on turtle shells, which makes identification tricky. An alternative approach based on DNA barcoding and high throughput sequencing (HTS), metabarcoding, has been developed in recent years to identify species at the community level by using a DNA reference library. The suitabilities of morphological and molecular approaches were compared. Diatom assemblages were sampled from seven juvenile green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from Mayotte Island, France. The structures of the epibiotic diatom assemblages differed between both approaches. This resulted in different clustering of the turtles based on their diatom communities. Metabarcoding allowed better discrimination between turtles based on their epibiotic diatom assemblages and put into evidence the presence of a cryptic diatom diversity. Microscopy, for its part, provided more ecological information of sea turtles based on historical bibliographical data and the abundances of ecological guilds of the diatom species present in the samples. This study shows the complementary nature of these two methods for studying turtle behavior.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","8",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","493","13","4","29659610","e0195770",NA,NA,2018

This study compares zooplankton taxonomic composition revealed through metabarcoding of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and 18S rRNA genes to traditional morphological identification by microscopy. Triplicates of three different sample types were collected from three coral reef sites in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary: (1) 1 L surface seawater samples prefiltered through 3 µm filters and subsequently collected on 0.22 µm filters for eDNA (PF-eDNA); (2) 1 L surface seawater samples filtered on 0.22 µm pore-size filters (environmental DNA; eDNA), and (3) zooplankton tissue samples from 64 µm, 200 µm, and 500 µm mesh size net tows. The zooplankton tissue samples were split, with half identified morphologically and tissue DNA (T-DNA) extracted from the other half. The COI and 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding of PF-eDNA, eDNA, and T-DNA samples was performed using Illumina MiSeq. Of the families detected with COI and 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding, 40% and 32%, respectively, were also identified through morphological assessments. Significant differences in taxonomic composition were observed between PF-DNA, eDNA, and T-DNA with both genetic markers. PF-eDNA resulted in detection of fewer taxa than the other two sample types; thus, prefiltering is not recommended.

Free-living nematodes are globally abundant and diverse in marine sediments, with species exhibiting distinct buccal cavity (mouth) morphologies that are thought to play an important role in feeding ecology and life history strategies. Here, we investigated patterns in marine nematode microbiomes, by characterizing host-associated microbial taxa in 281 worms isolated from a range of habitat types (deep-sea, shallow water, methane seeps, Lophelia coral mounds, kelp holdfasts) across three distinct geographic regions (Arctic, Southern California and Gulf of Mexico). Microbiome profiles were generated from single worms spanning 33 distinct morphological genera, using a two-gene metabarcoding approach to amplify the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene targeting bacteria/archaea and the V1–V2 region of the 18S rRNA gene targeting microbial eukaryotes. Contrary to our expectations, nematode microbiome profiles demonstrated no distinct patterns either globally (across depths and ocean basins) or locally (within site); prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial assemblages did not correlate with nematode feeding morphology, host phylogeny or morphological identity, ocean region or marine habitat type. However, fine-scale analysis of nematode microbiomes revealed a variety of novel ecological interactions, including putative parasites and symbionts, and potential associations with bacterial/archaeal taxa involved in nitrogen and methane cycling. Our results suggest that in marine habitats, free-living nematodes may utilize diverse and generalist foraging strategies that are not correlated with host genotype or feeding morphology.

Considering sequence abundance, Bryophyta is among the most abundant taxa in all analyzed BSCs suggesting that they were in a late successional stage. In terms of algal and cyanobacterial biodiversity, the genera Chloromonas, Coccomyxa, Elliptochloris and Nostoc were identified in all samples regardless of origin confirming their ubiquitous distribution. For the first time, we found the chrysophyte Spumella to be common in polar BSCs as it was present in all analyzed samples. Co-occurrence analysis revealed the presence of sulfur metabolizing microbes indicating that BSCs also play an important role for the sulfur cycle. In general, phototrophs were most abundant within the BSCs but there was also a diverse community of heterotrophs and saprotrophs. Our results show that BSCs are unique microecosystems in polar environments with an unexpectedly high biodiversity.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"19705","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","499","94","4","29514253",NA,NA,NA,2018

The foraging ecology of pelagic seabirds is difficult to characterize because of their large foraging areas. In the face of this difficulty, DNA metabarcoding may be a useful approach to analyze diet compositions and foraging behaviors. Using this approach, we investigated the diet composition and its seasonal variation of a common seabird species on the Ogasawara Islands, Japan: the wedge-tailed shearwater Ardenna pacifica. We collected fecal samples during the prebreeding (N = 73) and rearing (N = 96) periods. The diet composition of wedge-tailed shearwater was analyzed by Ion Torrent sequencing using two universal polymerase chain reaction primers for the 12S and 16S mitochondrial DNA regions that targeted vertebrates and mollusks, respectively. The results of a BLAST search of obtained sequences detected 31 and 1 vertebrate and mollusk taxa, respectively. The results of the diet composition analysis showed that wedge-tailed shearwaters frequently consumed deep-sea fishes throughout the sampling season, indicating the importance of these fishes as a stable food resource. However, there was a marked seasonal shift in diet, which may reflect seasonal changes in food resource availability and wedge-tailed shearwater foraging behavior. The collected data regarding the shearwater diet may be useful for in situ conservation efforts. Future research that combines DNA metabarcoding with other tools, such as data logging, may provide further insight into the foraging ecology of pelagic seabirds.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","501","13","4","29630670","e0195385",NA,NA,2018

Fungal communities in agricultural soils are assumed to be affected by soil and crop management. Our intention was to investigate the impact of different tillage and fertilization practices on fungal communities in a long-term crop rotation field trial established in 1992 in Central Germany. Two winter wheat fields in replicated strip-tillage design, comprising conventional vs. conservation tillage, intensive vs. extensive fertilization and different pre-crops (maize vs. rapeseed) were analyzed by a metabarcoding approach applying Illumina paired-end sequencing of amplicons generated by two recently developed primer pairs targeting the two fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer regions (ITS1, ITS2). Analysis of 5.1 million high-quality sequence reads uncovered a diverse fungal community in the two fields, composed of 296 fungal genera including 3,398 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) at the 97% sequence similarity threshold. Both primer pairs detected the same fungal phyla (Basidio-, Asco-, Zygo-, Glomero- and Chytridiomycota), but in different relative abundances. OTU richness was higher in the ITS1 dataset, while ITS2 data were more diverse and of higher evenness. Effects of farming practice on fungal community structures were revealed. Almost two-thirds of the fungal genera were represented in all different soil treatments, whereas the remaining genera clearly responded to farming practice. Principal Component Analysis revealed four distinct clusters according to tillage practice and pre-crop. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) substantiated the results and proved significant influences of tillage and pre-crop, while fertilization had the smallest and non-significant effect. In-depth analysis of putative phytopathogenic and plant beneficial fungal groups indicated distinct responses; for example Fusarium was significantly enriched in the intensively fertilized conservation tillage variants with the pre-crop maize, while Phoma displayed significant association with conventional tillage and pre-crop rapeseed. Many putative plant beneficial fungi also reacted differentially to farming practice with the most distinct responders identified among the Glomeromycota (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, AMF).","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","8",NA,"10600153309","undefined","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung","1","TRUE","502","13","4","29621291","e0195345",NA,NA,2018

Miscanthus x giganteus is well known for its ability to grow on metal contaminated soils. However, little is known concerning its metabolic changes including secondary metabolites under metal pressure. These changes might impact the diversity and function of associated bacterial populations. Thus, this study focused on evaluating the modifications of secondary metabolism production of M. x giganteus belowground parts (i.e. roots and rhizomes), and of rhizosphere bacterial communities under diverse contaminated conditions. Samples of M. x giganteus roots and rhizomes were collected from 3 sites exhibiting a gradient of metal pollution and extracted with MeOH:H2O. Secondary metabolic profiles of root and rhizome extracts were analyzed by UHPLC/DAD/ESI-QTOF. The structure and diversity of rhizosphere communities were studied using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed out the modification of the secondary metabolic profiles of M. x giganteus belowground parts, when they are grown on diversely contaminated soils. Major increased metabolites were identified as 3- and 5-feruloylquinic acid whereas decreased compound was 4-feruloylquinic acid. Metal contamination also led to a shift in rhizosphere bacterial composition and structure as well as the selection of some opportunistic pathogenic genera such as Pseudomonas or Stenotrophomonas but there was only a weak effect on the bacterial diversity and richness. In the context of a moderate metal contamination in agricultural soil slight changes were seen in the secondary metabolic profiles of M. x giganteus roots and rhizomes and their associated bacterial communities. Whether the metal-induced changes allow plants to recruit beneficial microbes that favor the adaptation process to this stress need to be further investigated.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Metabarcoding | Metal | Miscanthus x giganteus | Rhizosphere bacterial community | Root and rhizome | Secondary metabolite profile","96119","ANR-08-CESA-012",NA,"0","FALSE","503","125",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0929139317308405",2018

SUMMARY Ancient samples present a number of technical challenges for DNA barcoding, including damaged DNA with low endogenous copy number and short fragment lengths. Nevertheless, techniques are available to overcome these issues, and DNA barcoding has now been used to successfully recover parasite DNA from a wide variety of ancient substrates, including coprolites, cesspit sediment, mummified tissues, burial sediments and permafrost soils. The study of parasite DNA from ancient samples can provide a number of unique scientific insights, for example: (1) into the parasite communities and health of prehistoric human populations; (2) the ability to reconstruct the natural parasite faunas of rare or extinct host species, which has implications for conservation management and de-extinction; and (3) the ability to view in 'real-time' processes that may operate over century- or millenial-timescales, such as how parasites responded to past climate change events or how they co-evolved alongside their hosts. The application of DNA metabarcoding and high-throughput sequencing to ancient specimens has so far been limited, but in future promises great potential for gaining empirical data on poorly understood processes such as parasite co-extinction.","1","Journal","re","Review","100","1","archaeology | co-extinction | extinct species | fossils | Holocene | Key words:ancient DNA | Pleistocene","22993","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","504","145","5","29557324",NA,NA,"S0031182018000380",2018

Fungi are important agents in plant soil interactions but the belowground mycobiota associated with plants remains poorly understood. We grew one genotype each from Sweden and Italy of the widely-studied plant model Arabidopsis thaliana. Plants were grown under controlled conditions in organic topsoil local to the Swedish genotype, and harvested after ten weeks. Total DNA was extracted from three belowground compartments: endosphere (sonicated roots), rhizosphere and bulk soil, and fungal communities were characterized from each by amplification and sequencing of the fungal barcode region ITS2. Fungal species diversity was found to decrease from bulk soil to rhizosphere to endosphere. A significant effect of plant genotype on fungal community composition was detected only in the endosphere compartment. Despite A. thaliana being a non-mycorrhizal plant, it hosts a number of known mycorrhiza fungi in its endosphere compartment, which is also colonized by endophytic, pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi. Species in the Archaeorhizomycetes were most abundant in rhizosphere samples suggesting an adaptation to environments with high nutrient turnover for some of these species. We conclude that A. thaliana endosphere fungal communities represent a selected subset of fungi recruited from soil and that plant genotype has small but significant quantitative and qualitative effects on these communities.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Arabidopsis | Archaeorhizomcyetes | Brassicaceae | Ion Torrent | ITS metabarcoding | Rhizosphere","19700166901","DP150103414","Carl Tryggers Stiftelse för Vetenskaplig Forskning","1","TRUE","506","122","4","29551197",NA,NA,"S1878614618300023",2018

Multiple biotic and abiotic parameters influence the dynamics of individual fungal species and entire communities. Major drivers for tropical plant endophytes are undoubtedly seasonality, local habitat conditions and biogeography. However, host specialization and tissue preferences also contribute to the structuring of endophytic mycobiomes. To elucidate such specializations and preferences, we sampled two commercially important, unrelated plant species, Amorphophallus albispathus and Camellia sinensis (tea plant) simultaneously at close proximity. The mycobiomes of different tissue types were assessed with high-throughput amplicon sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer DNA region. Both plants hosted different fungal communities and varied in a- and ß-diversity, despite their neighboring occurrence. However, the fungal assemblages of Amorphophallus leaflets shared taxa with the mycobiomes of tea leaves, thereby suggesting common driving forces for leaf-inhabiting fungi irrespective of host plant identity. The mycobiome composition and diversity of tea leaves was clearly driven by leaf age. We suggest that the very youngest tea leaves are colonized by stochastic processes, while mycobiomes of old leaves are rather similar as the result of progressive succession. The biodiversity of fungi associated with A. albispathus was characterized by a large number of unclassified OTUs (at genus and species level) and by tissue-specific composition.This study is the first cultivation-independent high-throughput assessment of fungal biodiversity of an Amorphophallus species, and additionally expands the knowledge base on fungi associated with tea plants.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","18","Camellia | High-throughput metabarcoding | Host specialization | Mycobiome diversity | Tissue preferences of endophytes","5400152649","UN 262/9-1","German Academic Exchange Service London","0","FALSE","507","17","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Methods We investigated structure and characteristics of the microbiota of 40 healthy subjects through metabarcoding analysis of the V3–V4 regions of the 16s rRNA gene. Exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 was assessed with a personal sampler worn for 24 h before sample collection (Day -1) and with measurements from monitoring stations (from Day -2 to Day -7). Results We found an inverse association between PM10 and PM2.5 levels of the 3rd day preceding sampling (Day -3) and a-diversity indices (Chao1, Shannon and PD_whole_tree). Day -3 PM was inversely associated also with the majority of analyzed taxa, except for Moraxella, which showed a positive association. In addition, subjects showed different structural profiles identifying two groups: one characterized by an even community and another widely dominated by the Moraxella genus.

This study applied a 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding approach to characterize bacterial community compositional and functional attributes for surface water samples collected within, primarily, agriculturally dominated watersheds in Ontario and Québec, Canada. Compositional heterogeneity was best explained by stream order, season, and watercourse discharge. Generally, community diversity was higher at agriculturally dominated lower order streams, compared to larger stream order systems such as small to large rivers. However, during times of lower relative water flow and cumulative 2-day rainfall, modestly higher relative diversity was found in the larger watercourses. Bacterial community assemblages were more sensitive to environmental/land use changes in the smaller watercourses, relative to small-to-large river systems, where the proximity of the sampled water column to bacteria reservoirs in the sediments and adjacent terrestrial environment was greater. Stream discharge was the environmental variable most significantly correlated (all positive) with bacterial functional groups, such as C/N cycling and plant pathogens. Comparison of the community structural similarity via network analyses helped to discriminate sources of bacteria in freshwater derived from, for example, wastewater treatment plant effluent and intensity and type of agricultural land uses (e.g., intensive swine production vs. dairy dominated cash/livestock cropping systems). When using metabarcoding approaches, bacterial community composition and coexisting pattern rather than individual taxonomic lineages, were better indicators of environmental/land use conditions (e.g., upstream land use) and bacterial sources in watershed settings. Overall, monitoring changes and differences in aquatic microbial communities at regional and local watershed scales has promise for enhancing environmental footprinting and for better understanding nutrient cycling and ecological function of aquatic systems impacted by a multitude of stressors and land uses.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Agricultural watersheds | Aquatic bacterial community | Land use | Metabarcoding | Stream order","21100226442","CRTI 09S-462RD","Ministry of the Environment","1","TRUE","513","9",NA,NA,"2301",NA,NA,2018

In terrestrial herbivores, the digestive microbiota is known to degrade complex polysaccharides from land plants while in marine herbivores, the digestive microbiota is poorly characterized. Most of the latter are generalists and consume red, green, and brown macroalgae, three distinct lineages characterized by a specific composition in complex polysaccharides, which represent half of their biomass. Subsequently, each macroalga features a specific epiphytic microbiota, and the digestive microbiota of marine herbivores is expected to vary with a monospecific algal diet. We investigated the effect of four monospecific diets (Palmaria palmata, Ulva lactuca, Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata) on the composition and specificity of the digestive microbiota of a generalist marine herbivore, the abalone, farmed in a temperate coastal area over a year. The microbiota from the abalone digestive gland was sampled every 2 months and explored using metabarcoding. RESULTS: Diversity and multivariate analyses showed that patterns of the microbiota were significantly linked to seasonal variations of contextual parameters but not directly to a specific algal diet. Three core genera: Psychrilyobacter, Mycoplasma, and Vibrio constantly dominated the microbiota in the abalone digestive gland. Additionally, a less abundant and diet-specific core microbiota featured genera representing aerobic primary degraders of algal polysaccharides. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the establishment of a persistent core microbiota in the digestive gland of the abalone since its juvenile state and the presence of a less abundant and diet-specific core community. While composed of different microbial taxa compared to terrestrial herbivores, the digestive gland constitutes a particular niche in the abalone holobiont, where bacteria (i) may cooperate to degrade algal polysaccharides to products assimilable by the host or (ii) may have acquired these functions through gene transfer from the aerobic algal microbiota.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","Abalone | Digestive microbiota | Holobiont | Macroalgae | Microbe-host interactions","21100401152","ANR-10-BTBR-02-04-11","Agence Nationale de la Recherche","1","TRUE","514","6","1","29587830",NA,"ANR",NA,2018

A fundamental question in the archaeology of Madagascar is the extent to which arrival of settlers, introduction of non-native plants and animals, and subsequent human exploitation of island biota, which catalyzed declines in biodiversity and significantly degraded environmental conditions. Fine-grained datasets, including zooarchaeological, archaeobotanical and other ecological evidence, are needed to assess the relationship between human resource exploitation and environmental change. On Madagascar, the resolution of zooarchaeological datasets is often reduced by poor preservation of faunal remains, making precise taxonomic identifications difficult, and few projects to-date have comprehensively assessed zooarchaeological data. Here, we present zooarchaeological data from three coastal villages in the Velondriake Marine Protected Area in southwest Madagascar, where human occupation spans from ca. 1400 BP to the present. Faunal remains from the Late Holocene sites of Antsaragnagnangy and Antsaragnasoa were identified using morphological analysis of remains, and a PCR-based bulk bone metabarcoding approach was applied at Andamotibe to molecularly identify fish and other vertebrates in a faunal assemblage that was particularly fragmented. Results were interpreted and contextualized using modern data on local fish diversity, climate and anthropogenic impacts on marine and estuarine habitats, as well as modern fishing practices (including preferred fishing grounds, tackle, taxonomic representation and volume of catch). Our use of multiple analytical and interpretative approaches has provided the most highly resolved view to date of past human subsistence in coastal southwest Madagascar. We contend that future research into human-environment dynamics on Madagascar should make use of diverse analytical methods, in order to more comprehensively evaluate past interactions between human communities and the native biota. Furthermore, we encourage an historical ecological approach, so that long-term perspectives on changing human-environment dynamics may be used to contextualize modern trends.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Ancient DNA | Biodiversity | Fishing | Foraging | Madagascar | Zooarchaeology","25776","DP160104473","Yale University","0","FALSE","515","471",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S1040618217305165",2018

The soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines Ichinohe (Phylum Nematoda), is a major pathogen of soybean. It causes substantial yield losses worldwide and is difficult to control because the cyst protects the eggs which can remain viable for nearly a decade. Crop rotation with non-host crops and use of biocontrol organisms such as fungi and bacteria offer promising approaches, but remain hampered by lack of knowledge of the biology of nematode parasitic organisms. We used a high-throughput metabarcoding approach to characterize fungal communities associated with the SCN cyst, a microenvironment in soil that may harbor both nematode parasites and plant pathogens. SCN cysts were collected from a long-term crop rotation experiment in Southeastern Minnesota at three time points over two growing seasons to characterize diversity of fungi inhabiting cysts and to examine how crop rotation and seasonal variation affects fungal communities. A majority of fungi in cysts belonged to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, but the presence of several early diverging fungal subphyla thought to be primarily plant and litter associated, including Mortierellomycotina and Glomeromycotina (e.g., arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi), suggests a possible role as nematode egg parasites. Species richness varied by both crop rotation and season and was higher in early years of crop rotation and in fall at the end of the growing season. Crop rotation and season also impacted fungal community composition and identified several classes of fungi, including Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Orbiliomycetes (e.g., nematode trapping fungi), with higher relative abundance in early soybean rotations. The relative abundance of several genera was correlated with increasing years of soybean. Fungal communities also varied by season and were most divergent at midseason. The percentage of OTUs assigned to Mortierellomycotina_cls_Incertae_sedis and Sordariomycetes increased at midseason, while Orbiliomycetes decreased at midseason, and Glomeromycetes increased in fall. Ecological guilds of fungi containing an animal-pathogen lifestyle, as well as potential egg-parasitic taxa previously isolated from parasitized SCN eggs, increased at midseason. The animal pathogen guilds included known (e.g., Pochonia chlamydosporia) and new candidate biocontrol organisms.

However, the impact of NO-mediated biofilm dispersal on the taxa composition of natural communities as well as the potential selection for non-responding community members have rarely been addressed. Here, we investigated the effect of diethylenetriamine (DETA) NONOate, an NO donor with a long half-life, on biofilm dispersal of a bacterial community responsible for membrane biofouling to address this question. The biofilm of a complex community from a fouled industrial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane was dispersed over 50% by 500 µM of DETA NONOate treatment in a continuous flow system. Once-daily treatment with DETA NONOate in a laboratory-scale RO system demonstrated its anti-biofouling effect by delaying the transmembrane pressure increase during constant-flux filtration.

Introduction: Herbal medicines play an important role globally in the health care sector and in industrialised countries they are often considered as an alternative to mono-substance medicines. Current quality and authentication assessment methods rely mainly on morphology and analytical phytochemistry-based methods detailed in pharmacopoeias. Herbal products however are often highly processed with numerous ingredients, and even if these analytical methods are accurate for quality control of specific lead or marker compounds, they are of limited suitability for the authentication of biological ingredients. Objective: To review the benefits and limitations of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding in complementing current herbal product authentication. Method: Recent literature relating to DNA based authentication of medicinal plants, herbal medicines and products are summarised to provide a basic understanding of how DNA barcoding and metabarcoding can be applied to this field. Results: Different methods of quality control and authentication have varying resolution and usefulness along the value chain of these products. DNA barcoding can be used for authenticating products based on single herbal ingredients and DNA metabarcoding for assessment of species diversity in processed products, and both methods should be used in combination with appropriate hyphenated chemical methods for quality control. Conclusions: DNA barcoding and metabarcoding have potential in the context of quality control of both well and poorly regulated supply systems. Standardisation of protocols for DNA barcoding and DNA sequence-based identification are necessary before DNA-based biological methods can be implemented as routine analytical approaches and approved by the competent authorities for use in regulated procedures. © 2017 The Authors.

Fungal spores and mycelium fragments are particles which become and remain airborne and have been subjects of aerobiological studies. The presence and the abundance of taxa in aerobiological samples can be very variable and impaired by changeable climatic conditions. Because many fungi produce mycotoxins and both their mycelium fragments and spores are potential allergens, monitoring the presence of these taxa is of key importance. So far data on exposure and sensitization to fungal allergens are mainly based on the assessment of few, easily identifiable taxa and focused only on certain environments. The microscopic method used to analyze aerobiological samples and the inconspicuous fungal characters do not allow a in depth taxonomical identification. Here, we present a first assessment of fungal diversity from airborne samples using a DNA metabarcoding analysis. The nuclear ITS2 region was selected as barcode to catch fungal diversity in mixed airborne samples gathered during two weeks in four sites of North-Eastern and Central Italy. We assessed the taxonomic composition and diversity within and among the sampled sites and compared the molecular data with those obtained by traditional microscopy. The molecular analyses provide a tenfold more comprehensive determination of the taxa than the traditional morphological inspections. Our results prove that the metabarcoding analysis is a promising approach to increases quality and sensitivity of the aerobiological monitoring.

Yet, this mechanism is not well understood in flying insectivorous animals. This is particularly true of bats, where many ecologically similar or cryptic species coexist. The detailed analysis of the foraging niche in sympatric, cryptic sibling species provides an excellent framework to disentangle the role of specific niche factors likely involved in facilitating coexistence. We used DNA metabarcoding to determine the prey species consumed by a population of sympatric sibling Rhinolophus euryale and Rhinolophus mehelyi whose use of habitat in both sympatric and allopatric ranges has been well established through radio tracking. Although some subtle dietary differences exist in prey species composition, the diet of both bats greatly overlapped (O jk  = 0.83) due to the consumption of the same common and widespread moths. Those dietary differences we did detect might be related to divergences in prey availabilities among foraging habitats, which prior radio tracking on the same population showed are differentially used and selected when both species co-occur. This minor dietary segregation in sympatry may be the result of foraging on the same prey-types and could contribute to reduce potential competitive interactions (e.g., for prey, acoustic space).

Metabarcoding is a promising DNA-based method for identifying airborne pollen from environmental samples with advantages over microscopic methods. Sample preparation and DNA extraction are of fundamental importance for obtaining an optimal DNA yield. Currently, there is no standard procedure for these steps, especially for gravimetric pollen samplers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop protocols for processing environmental samples for pollen DNA extraction and for metabarcoding analysis and to assess the efficacy of these protocols for the taxonomic assignment of airborne pollen collected by gravimetric (Tauber trap) and volumetric (Hirst-type trap) samplers. Protocols were tested across an increasing complexity of samples, from pure single-species pollen to environmental multi-species samples. A short fragment (about 150 base pairs) of the chloroplast trnL gene was amplified using universal primers for plants. After PCR amplification, amplicons were Sanger-sequenced and taxonomic assignment was accomplished by comparison with a custom-made reference database including chloroplast DNA sequences from most of the anemophilous taxa occurring in the study area (Trentino, northern Italy), representing 46 plant families. Using the classical morphological pollen analysis as a benchmark, we show that DNA metabarcoding is efficient and applicable even in complex samples, provided that protocols for sample preparation, DNA extraction, and metabarcoding analysis are carefully optimized.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Aerobiology | Cloning | DNA extraction | Sanger-sequencing | trnL","52691","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","522","34","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Diatoms are a species-diverse phylum of microalgae often presenting high biomass in aquatic habitats. This makes them excellent ecological indicators in rivers and lakes. They are routinely used to assess ecological quality of rivers and lakes using microscopy, which is time consuming. An alternative is to determine species in samples based on short DNA barcodes and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Former studies showed that community structure and water quality assessments based on diatoms deliver similar results with both methods. But, none evaluated if diversities were assessed in the same way despite the importance of this ecological metric. Based on littoral benthic samplings carried out in 56 pristine alpine lakes, we compared different diversity indices measured with microscopy and metabarcoding. Each lake was sampled in three different places of its littoral. We showed that a (diversity measured in a single sampling site of a given lake) and <U+03D2> (total diversity in a lake where three independent samples were considered) diversities obtained with HTS were higher than those obtained with microscopy. This may be explained by the capacity of HTS to detect morphologically cryptic species and to better detect rare taxa. On the other hand, ß diversity obtained with HTS was smaller, which may be explained by the capacity of HTS to detect very rare species and free-floating extracellular DNA. Nevertheless, diversity indices obtained with both methodologies were well correlated each other. This study validates the possibility to assess diatom diversity with HTS in a comparable way to the classical microscopic analysis.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Diatom | Diversity | Environmental DNA | Metabarcoding | OTU","12956","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","523","18","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Here, we investigated a bloom of the raphidophyte Heterosigma akashiwo in the East China Sea in 2014 using metabarcode (18S rDNA) and metatranscriptome sequencing. Based on 18S rDNA analyses, the phytoplankton community shifted from high diversity in the pre-bloom stage to H. akashiwo predominance during the bloom. A sharp decrease in ambient dissolved inorganic phosphate and strong up-regulation of phosphate and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) uptake genes, including the rarely documented (ppGpp)ase, in H. akashiwo from pre-bloom to bloom was indicative of rapid phosphorus uptake and efficient utilization of DOP that might be a driver of the H. akashiwo bloom. Furthermore, observed up-regulated expression of mixotrophy-related genes suggests potential contribution of mixotrophy to the bloom. Accelerating photosynthetic carbon fixation was also implied by the up-regulation of carbonic anhydrase genes during the bloom. Notably, we also observed a strong morning-to-afternoon shift in the expression of many genes. Our findings provide insights into metabolic processes likely important for H. akashiwo bloom formation, and suggest the need to consider timing of sampling in field studies on this alga.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","10",NA,"19683","2017YFC1404302","China Scholarship Council","0","FALSE","527","20","3","29345115",NA,"UCONN",NA,2018

Understanding the basic natural history of threatened primate taxa is crucial to developing and implementing successful conservation strategies for them. Data on feeding ecology and activity patterns are particularly important for identifying the strategies through which primates invest time and foraging effort towards survival and reproduction at a given locale. Here, we report the results of the first study of the diet and activity budget of Arsi geladas, a population of OpenSPiltSPi 1000 individuals endemic to a heavily disturbed region of the southern Ethiopian Highlands and believed to represent a new taxon of geladas. We conducted our research on a band of 34 individuals belonging to five, one-male units at Indetu, eastern Arsi, Ethiopia, from August 2010 to May 2011 (excluding March 2011). Feeding accounted for 41.7% of total scans, followed by moving (20.3%), resting (19.0%), and social behavior (19.0%). Feeding and moving increased and resting and socializing decreased during the dry season when food availability was probably lower than during the wet season. Geladas ate mostly graminoid leaves (51.7% of feeding scans) though they also consumed graminoid rhizomes (24.4%), forb tubers (7.1%), forb leaves (7.1%), cactus, shrub, and tree fruits (3.6%), graminoid corms (1.7%), forb roots (1.6%), and unidentified items (3.0%). Underground foods (corms, rhizomes, roots, and tubers) accounted for 22–47% (mean = 35%) of the monthly (n = 9) diet and were eaten slightly more during the wet season than during the dry season. Contributions of human crops to the gelada diet could not be quantified without creating conflict between farmers and researchers, though we did note that geladas visited farms on 5–10% of study days. Threats from farmers, children, and dogs limited the geladas’ access to crops once they entered the farms. Further research involving questionnaire surveys of farmers, direct observation of crop damage by geladas, and DNA metabarcoding of gelada feces are crucial to the development of strategies to mitigate human-gelada conflict in the densely populated Arsi Zone of Ethiopia.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Activity budget | Anthropogenic disturbance | Crop raiding | Diet | Ethiopian Highlands","23336","10051364","Columbus Zoo and Aquarium","0","FALSE","528","59","2","29230674",NA,NA,NA,2018

No observations of macrobiota have yet been made for subglacial geothermal environments in Antarctica, but these organisms are often patchily distributed and can be difficult to find. We carried out metabarcoding (eDNA) analyses of soil samples taken from exposed areas on three volcanoes in Victoria Land, and subglacial caves on Mount Erebus.

Journal of Animal Ecology © 2017 British Ecological Society Detecting interaction between species is notoriously difficult, and disentangling species associations in host-related gut communities is especially challenging. Nevertheless, due to contemporary methods, including metabarcoding and 16S sequencing, collecting observational data on community composition has become easier and much more common. We studied the previously collected datasets of intestinal bacterial microbiota and parasite compositions within longitudinally followed mouse lemurs by analysing the potential interactions with diversity metrics and novel joint species distribution modelling. Both methods showed statistical association between certain parasite species and bacterial microbiota composition. Unicellular Eimeria sp. had an effect on diversity of gut microbiota. The cestode Hymenolepis diminuta had negative associations with several bacterial orders, whereas closely related species Hymenolepis nana had positive associations with several bacterial orders. Our results reveal potential interactions between some, but not all, intestinal parasites and gut bacterial microbiota. Host variables contributed over half of the total variation explained with the model, and sex was the most important single host variable; especially with microbiota, there were sex-related differences in the community composition. This study shows how joint species distribution modelling can incorporate both within-host dynamics of several taxa and host characteristics to model potential interactions in intestinal community. These results provide new hypothesis for interactions between and among parasites and bacterial microbiota to be tested further with experimental studies.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","helminths | joint species distribution modelling | Microcebus | primates","29544","undefined","Helsingin Yliopiston Tiedesäätiö","1","TRUE","530","87","2","28555881",NA,NA,NA,2018

Research on the amphibian skin microbiota has focused on identifying bacterial taxa that deter a pathogenic chytrid fungus, and on describing patterns of microbiota variation. However, it remains unclear how environmental variation affects amphibian skin bacterial communities, and whether the overall functional diversity of the amphibian skin microbiota is associated to such variation. We sampled skin microbial communities from one dendrobatoid frog species across an environmental gradient along the Panama Canal, and from three dendrobatoid frog species before and after the onset of the wet season in one site. We found frog skin microbial alpha diversity to be highest in frogs from sites with low soil pH, but no clear effect of the onset of the wet season. However, we found frog skin microbial community structure to be affected by soil pH and the onset of the wet season, which also resulted in a decrease in between-sample variation. Across the sampled frog species, bacterial functional groups changed with the onset of the wet season, with certain bacterial functional groups entirely disappearing and others differing in their relative abundances. In particular, we found the proportion of Bd-inhibitory bacteria to correlate with mean soil pH, and to increase in two of the frog species with the onset of the wet season. Taken together, our results suggest that structure and predicted function of amphibian bacterial skin communities may be influenced by environmental variables such as pH and precipitation, site effects, and host effects.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Abiotic factors | Allobates talamancae | Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis | Chytrid | Dendrobates auratus | Frog skin microbiota | Metabarcoding | Silverstoneia flotator","21100226442","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","531","9","FEB",NA,"298",NA,NA,2018

Although horizontal transfer is generally considered the prevalent route for the acquisition of gut bacteria in mammals [2], some bacterial lineages have co-speciated with their hosts on timescales of several million years [3]. Termites harbor a complex gut microbiota, and their advanced social behavior provides the potential for long-term vertical symbiont transmission, and co-evolution of gut symbionts and host [4–6]. Despite clear evolutionary patterns in the gut microbiota of termites [7], a consensus on how microbial communities were assembled during termite diversification has yet to be reached. Although some studies have concluded that vertical transmission has played a major role [8, 9], others indicate that diet and gut microenvironment have been the primary determinants shaping microbial communities in termite guts [7, 10]. To address this issue, we examined the gut microbiota of 94 termite species, through 16S rRNA metabarcoding. We analyzed the phylogeny of 211 bacterial lineages obtained from termite guts, including their closest relatives from other environments, which were identified using BLAST. The results provided strong evidence for rampant horizontal transfer of gut bacteria between termite host lineages. Although the majority of termite-derived phylotypes formed large monophyletic groups, indicating high levels of niche specialization, numerous other clades were interspersed with bacterial lineages from the guts of other animals. Our results indicate that “mixed-mode” transmission, which combines colony-to-offspring vertical transmission with horizontal colony-to-colony transfer, has been the primary driving force shaping the gut microbiota of termites. Using 16S rRNA metagenome data, Bourguignon et al. show that termite gut microbiota is shaped through “mixed-mode” transmission, combining colony-to-offspring vertical transmission with occasional horizontal colony-to-colony transfer on timescales of tens of million years.","8","Journal","ar","Article","100","8",NA,"15537","IGA A13/17","Australian Research Council","1","TRUE","532","28","4","29429621",NA,NA,"S096098221830037X",2018

Background: Understanding feedback between above- and below-ground processes of biological communities is a key to the effective management of natural and agricultural ecosystems. However, as above- and below-ground food webs are often studied separately, our knowledge of material flow and community dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems remains limited. Results: We developed a high-throughput sequencing method for examining how spiders link above- and below-ground food webs as generalist predators. To overcome problems related to DNA-barcoding-based analyses of arthropod-arthropod interactions, we designed spider-specific blocking primers and Hexapoda-specific primers for the selective PCR amplification of Hexapoda prey sequences from spider samples. By applying the new DNA metabarcoding framework to spider samples collected in a temperate secondary forest in Japan, we explored the structure of a food web involving 15 spider species and various taxonomic groups of Hexapoda prey. These results support the hypothesis that multiple spider species in a community can prey on both above- and below-ground prey species, potentially coupling above- and below-ground food-web dynamics.

In recent decades, show caves have begun to suffer from microorganism proliferation due to artificial lighting installations for touristic activity. In addition to the aesthetic problem, light encourages microorganisms that are responsible for physical and chemical degradation of limestone walls, speleothems and prehistoric paintings of cultural value. Microorganisms have previously been described by microscopy or culture-dependent methods, but data provided by new generation sequencing are rare. The authors identified, for the first time, microorganisms proliferating in one Swiss and in four French show caves using three different primers.

Comparing microbial communities from bleach-treated caves to those in untreated caves showed no significant difference except for a low-level change in the abundance of certain taxa.

Reconstructing the natural, unmodified ecosystems that preceded these events relies on high-resolution analyses of paleoecological deposits. Coprolites are a source of uniquely detailed information about trophic interactions and the behaviors, gut parasite communities, and microbiotas of prehistoric animal species. Such insights are critical for understanding the legacy effects of extinctions on ecosystems, and can help guide contemporary conservation and ecosystem restoration efforts. Here we use high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of ancient eukaryotic DNA from coprolites to reconstruct aspects of the biology and ecology of four species of extinct moa and the critically endangered kakapo parrot from New Zealand (NZ). Importantly, we provide evidence that moa and prehistoric kakapo consumed ectomycorrhizal fungi, suggesting these birds played a role in dispersing fungi that are key to NZ’s natural forest ecosystems. We also provide the first DNA-based evidence that moa frequently supplemented their broad diets with ferns and mosses. Finally, we also find parasite taxa that provide insight into moa behavior, and present data supporting the hypothesis of coextinction between moa and several parasite species. Our study demonstrates that HTS sequencing of coprolites provides a powerful tool for resolving key aspects of ancient ecosystems and may rapidly provide information not obtainable by conventional paleoecological techniques, such as fossil analyses.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Ancient DNA | Coprolites | Metabarcoding | Moa | New Zealand","21121","undefined","John Templeton Foundation","1","TRUE","535","115","7","29440415",NA,NA,NA,2018

We identified nine putative species of parasites, although their correspondence to actual parasite species is not clear as the resolution of the marker gene differs between nematode clades. For the host species that we successfully sampled with 10 or more positive occurrences of nematodes, i.e., mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus), black rats (Rattus rattus), and frogs (Anura), the parasite assemblage compositions differed significantly among host species, sampling sites, and sampling years.

Metabarcoding provides a much greater level of detail than PLFA profiling does, but it remains unclear whether or not the two techniques have a similar ability to answer many of the common questions asked by ecologists. We test the relative ability of the two techniques to quantify differences in bacterial community structure among five land uses (natural and planted forest, unimproved and improved grasslands, and vineyards), and to predict ecosystem functions. We also test whether PLFA- and metabarcoding-based metrics indicative of microbial growth strategies are correlated to each other. We show that both techniques showed broadly similar patterns of bacterial community composition change with land use and a remarkably similar ability to predict a wide range of ecosystem functions (carbon and nutrient cycling, and responses to drought). However, they were also complementary, as each showed different strengths in discriminating land uses and predicting ecosystem functions. PLFA metrics (i.e. the gram-positive:gram-negative ratio and fungal:bacterial ratio) were strongly correlated with the equivalent 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding metrics (i.e. the gram-positive:gram-negative and oligotrophic:copiotrophic ratios), although PLFA metrics were less well correlated with the Proteobacteria:Acidobacteria ratio.

Such macrofauna-based environmental impact assessments (EIA), however, are very time consuming and expensive. To overcome these shortcomings, we used environmental metabarcoding to test the potential of protists as bioindicators in EIAs. Therefore, we analyzed taxonomic metabarcodes (V9 region of the SSU rRNA), obtained from sediment samples collected along a 400-m transect extending from below salmon cages towards the open sea along the predominant current flow. The obtained genetic data of protistan communities were compared to benchmark data obtained from traditional macrofauna surveys of the same samples. Ciliates emerged as the most powerful indicators mirroring the macrofauna benchmark patterns with statistical significance. Ordination analyses showed that ciliate communities resolved impacted sampling sites below and in immediate vicinity of the salmon cages even better than macrofauna communities. It can be concluded that ciliates allow for a better fine-scale resolution of impact conditions than traditional monitoring methods.

We employed a dual-primer DNA metabarcoding approach to characterize arthropod 16S and COI DNA sequences within bat faecal pellets collected across 16 Southern European localities, to first characterize the bat species’ dietary niche, second measure the incidence of agricultural pests across their ranges and third assess whether geographical dietary variation responds to climatic, landscape diversity, agriculture type and vegetation productivity factors. We detected 12 arthropod orders, among which lepidopterans were predominant. We identified >200 species, 44 of which are known to cause agricultural damage. Pest species were detected at all but one sampling site and in 94% of the analysed samples. Furthermore, the dietary diversity of M. schreibersii exhibited a negative linear relation with the area of intensive agricultural fields, thus suggesting crops restrict the dietary niche of bats to prey taxa associated with agricultural production within their foraging range.

The larval pool of coral reef fish has a crucial role in the dynamics of adult fish populations. However, large-scale species-level monitoring of species-rich larval pools has been technically impractical. Here, we use high-throughput metabarcoding to study larval ecology in the Gulf of Aqaba, a region that is inhabited by >500 reef fish species. We analysed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples that were stratified over sites, depth and time. Metagenomic DNA extracted from pooled larvae was matched to a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I barcode database compiled for 77% of known fish species within this region. This yielded species-level reconstruction of the larval community, allowing robust estimation of larval spatio-temporal distributions. We found significant correlations between species abundance in the larval pool and in local adult assemblages, suggesting a major role for larval supply in determining local adult densities. We documented larval flux of species whose adults were never documented in the region, suggesting environmental filtering as the reason for the absence of these species. Larvae of several deep-sea fishes were found in shallow waters, supporting their dispersal over shallow bathymetries, potentially allowing Lessepsian migration into the Mediterranean Sea.

This has traditionally been based on benthic macrofaunal communities, which is reliant on taxonomic expertise, and turn-around times can be slow, limiting opportunities for adaptive management. Environmental metabarcoding is a powerful high-throughput sequencing-based technique that can identify and quantify benthic assemblages. Previous studies have demonstrated relationships between specific taxonomic groups (e.g., bacteria, foraminifera) and anthropogenic effects. However, the absence of fixed categorical scales makes the use of data challenging for routine biomonitoring. In this study, we analysed 105 sediment samples collected over three years from three salmon farms spanning two separate bioregions. Environmental DNA and RNA (eDNA/eRNA) metabarcoding of three taxonomic groups (foraminifera, bacteria, and general eukaryotes) was undertaken in parallel with traditional macrofaunal and biochemical analyses, which were used to calculate an Enrichment Stage index for each sample. The most abundant 200–250 Operational Taxonomic Units in each taxonomic group were assessed and assigned to Eco-Groups. These bioindicator taxa were then used to develop a Metabarcoding Biotic Index for each taxonomic group individually and in combination (multi-trophic Metabarcoding Biotic Index). The weakest relationship was between the foraminiferal Metabarcoding Biotic Index and Enrichment Stage (eDNA/eRNA, R2 = 0.731–0.850), whereas strong correspondence was obtained between the multi-trophic Metabarcoding Biotic Index and Enrichment Stage, or when just bacteria and eukaryotes data were combined (eDNA/RNA, R2 > 0.900). The strong relationships obtained between the multi-trophic Metabarcoding Biotic Index and Enrichment Stage confirms that this method has the potential to complement or even replace current fish farm biomonitoring techniques in the near future.","14","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","18S ribosomal RNA gene | Aquaculture | Bacteria | Benthic enrichment | Eukaryotes | High throughput sequencing | Macrofauna","20292","1506","Seafood Innovations","0","FALSE","543","85",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S1470160X17307264",2018

Benthic diatoms are relevant indicators of the ecological status of the littoral zone of lakes. Their use as bio-indicators is based on their morphological identification at species level using microscopy which is time consuming, requires taxonomic expertise, and is consequently expensive. To overcome these limitations, a molecular approach for diatom identification has been tested with success in rivers. DNA metabarcoding enables species identification from a standardized DNA barcode and high-throughput sequencing (HTS), using DNA reference library. The suitability of the morphological and molecular approaches to assess the diatom community structure and the ecological status of the littoral zone of the largest deep lake in France (Lake Bourget) was compared. 66 sites were sampled in August 2015 along the shoreline, all around the lake. The composition of diatom assemblages was similar with both morphological and molecular approaches, and diatom assemblages were structured by the same environmental factors. However, the ecological status of Lake Bourget differed significantly among approaches since floristic inventories to species level also differed significantly. The main source of this difference was the incompleteness of the DNA reference library. Nevertheless, in a near future, when this constraint will be solved, the use of DNA metabarcoding for biomonitoring purposes seems promising.","14","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Algae | Benthic biomonitoring | Eutrophication | High-throughput sequencing | Lake Bourget | Pollution","15168","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","545","807","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Here, we utilized the third-generation Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RSII and Sequel instruments to evaluate the suitability of full-length internal transcribed spacer (ITS) barcodes and longer rRNA gene amplicons for metabarcoding Fungi, Oomycetes and other eukaryotes in soil samples. Metabarcoding revealed multiple errors and biases: Taq polymerase substitution errors and mis-incorporating indels in sequencing homopolymers constitute major errors; sequence length biases occur during PCR, library preparation, loading to the sequencing instrument and quality filtering; primer–template mismatches bias the taxonomic profile when using regular and highly degenerate primers. The RSII and Sequel platforms enable the sequencing of amplicons up to 3000 bp, but the sequence quality remains slightly inferior to Illumina sequencing especially in longer amplicons. The full ITS barcode and flanking rRNA small subunit gene greatly improve taxonomic identification at the species and phylum levels, respectively.

The recent recolonization of Central Europe by the European gray wolf (Canis lupus) provides an opportunity to study the dynamics of parasite transmission for cases when a definitive host returns after a phase of local extinction. We investigated whether a newly established wolf population increased the prevalence of those parasites in ungulate intermediate hosts representing wolf prey, whether some parasite species are particularly well adapted to wolves, and the potential basis for such adaptations. We recorded Sarcocystis species richness in wolves and Sarcocystis prevalence in ungulates harvested in study sites with and without permanent wolf presence in Germany using microscopy and DNA metabarcoding. Sarcocystis prevalence in red deer (Cervus elaphus) was significantly higher in wolf areas (79.7%) than in control areas (26.3%) but not in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (97.2% vs. 90.4%) or wild boar (Sus scrofa) (82.8% vs. 64.9%). Of 11 Sarcocystis species, Sarcocystis taeniata and Sarcocystis grueneri occurred more often in wolves than expected from the Sarcocystis infection patterns of ungulate prey. Both Sarcocystis species showed a higher increase in prevalence in ungulates in wolf areas than other Sarcocystis species, suggesting that they are particularly well adapted to wolves, and are examples of “wolf specialists”. Sarcocystis species richness in wolves was significantly higher in pups than in adults. “Wolf specialists” persisted during wolf maturation. The results of this study demonstrate that (1) predator–prey interactions influence parasite prevalence, if both predator and prey are part of the parasite life cycle, (2) mesopredators do not necessarily replace the apex predator in parasite transmission dynamics for particular parasites of which the apex predator is the definitive host, even if meso- and apex predators were from the same taxonomic family (here: Canidae, e.g., red foxes Vulpes vulpes), and (3) age-dependent immune maturation contributes to the control of protozoan infection in wolves.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","apicomplexa | coccidia | endoparasites | epidemiology | metabarcoding | protozoa | Sarcocystis | ungulates","21100264002","undefined","Leibniz-Gemeinschaft","1","TRUE","547","8","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Microbial communities associated to the gut of insects are attracting an increasing interest, mainly because of their role in influencing several host life-traits. The characterization of the gut microbial community is pivotal for understanding insect ecology and, thus, to develop novel pest management strategies. The pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pytiocampa (Denis & Schiff.) (Lepidoptera: Thaumetopoeidae), is a severe defoliator of pine forests, able to feed on several pine species. In this work, we performed a metabarcoding analysis to investigate, for the first time, the diversity of the gut bacterial community of pine processionary larvae associated with three different host pine species (Pinus halepensis, Pinus nigra subsp. laricio, and Pinus pinaster). We found that the gut microbial community of T. pityocampa larvae collected on P. halapensis was different from that associated with larvae collected from P. nigra and P. pinaster. Moreover, the high presence of bacteria belonging to the genera Modestobacter, Delftia, and unidentified Methylobacteriaceae retrieved in larvae feeding on P. halapensis suggested that specific interactions can occur.

Here we compare morphological identification to HTS based identification of macroinvertebrate families by considering 12 sites in an urban river system. Some taxa detected morphologically were not detected by HTS and vice versa. However, this had only a small impact on computed family-level metrics of ecological condition. We detected multiple species using HTS in the Chironomidae, Coenagrionidae, Hydrobiidae, Leptoceridae, Ceratopogonidae, Corixidae, Veliidae, Oligochaeta and Acarina. The highest species diversity was found in the Chironomidae, and for many of these species we had prior knowledge of their likely pollution sensitivity.

Conspicuous physicochemical vertical stratification in the deep sea is one of the main forces driving microbial diversity in the oceans. Oxygen and sunlight availability are key factors promoting microbial diversity throughout the water column. Ocean currents also play a major role in the physicochemical stratification, carrying oxygen down to deeper zones as well as moving deeper water masses up towards shallower depths. Water samples within a 50-km radius in a pockmark location of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean were collected and the prokaryotic communities from different water depths - chlorophyll maximum, oxygen minimum and deep-sea bottom (down to 1355 m) - were described. At phylum level, Proteobacteria were the most frequent in all water depths, Cyanobacteria were statistically more frequent in chlorophyll maximum zone, while Thaumarchaeota were significantly more abundant in both oxygen minimum and bottom waters. The most frequent microorganism in the chlorophyll maximum and oxygen minimum zones was a Pelagibacteraceae operational taxonomic unit (OTU). At the bottom, the most abundant genus was the archaeon Nitrosopumilus. Beta diversity analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data uncovered in this study shows high spatial heterogeneity among water zones communities.

We used metabarcoding and experimental manipulation of soil microbiomes to investigate the impact of soil and root microbes in a well-known case of sympatric speciation, the Howea palms of Lord Howe Island (Australia). Whereas H. forsteriana can grow on both calcareous and volcanic soils, H. belmoreana is restricted to, but more successful on, volcanic soil, indicating a trade-off in adaptation to the two soil types. We suggest a novel explanation for this trade-off. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are significantly depleted in H. forsteriana on volcanic soil, relative to both H. belmoreana on volcanic soil and H. forsteriana on calcareous soil. This is mirrored by the results of survival experiments, where the sterilization of natural soil reduces Howea fitness in every soil–species combination except H. forsteriana on volcanic soil. Furthermore, AMF-associated genes exhibit evidence of divergent selection between Howea species. These results show a mechanism by which divergent adaptation can have knock-on effects on host–microbe interactions, thereby reducing interspecific competition and promoting the coexistence of plant sister species.","9","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","coexistence | ecological speciation | edaphic adaptation | mycorrhizae | Palmae | symbiosis | sympatric speciation","19908","undefined","Natural Environment Research Council","1","TRUE","557","217","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Using terrestrial model ecosystems (TMEs), we investigated how reduced moisture conditions impact soil fungal communities from a temperate grassland over the course of an entire season. Starting at about 65% of the soil’s maximum water holding capacity (WHC max ), TME soils were adjusted to three moisture levels for 15 weeks: 70% WHC max , approximating starting conditions, 50% WHC max , and 30% WHC max , representing reduced moisture conditions. Diversity and abundances of soil fungi at the start and at the end of the experiment were characterized using Illumina meta-barcoding. Community diversity at the end of the experiment did not differ between experimental moisture levels and was comparable to diversity measures from the field. However, fungal communities did change compositionally in both abundances and presence/absence of species. Analyzing class-level and individual contributions of fungi to these changes revealed that only a minor portion reacted significantly, indicating that most compositional change was likely driven by many consistent small-scale shifts in presence/absences or abundances. Together, our results show that prolonged reduction in soil moisture conditions will trigger compositional changes in soil fungal communities but not necessarily change overall diversity. We highlight the cumulative contribution of minor but consistent changes among community members, as opposed to significant responses of individual species. We also detected a strong general experimental effect on soil fungi that are moved from the field to experimental TMEs, suggesting the importance of acclimatization effects in these communities under laboratory conditions.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Community ecology | Illumina metabarcoding | Soil fungi | Soil moisture | Terrestrial model ecosystems (TME)","20266","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","558","75","2","28785816",NA,NA,NA,2018

Modern functional and phylogenetic approaches in community ecology represent powerful tools to enhance the entire rehabilitation process and to overcome these challenges, but methodologies that incorporate up-to-date phylogenetic information or knowledge about intraspecific variation along rehabilitation trajectories must be developed. Functional and phylogenetic criteria may play an especially important role in guiding the definition of faster-growing, more resistant species mixtures that can be applied in mine land revegetation and rehabilitation. Limiting similarity approaches may help to reduce biological invasions, enabling native vegetation to outcompete alien invasive species and aiding in the development of enduring mechanisms for controlling such species in rehabilitated mine land.

Here, we applied a metabarcoding approach to examine the impact of urbanisation on the gut microbiota of Passer domesticus. We found urbanisation to be associated to lower microbiota species diversity, modifications in taxonomic composition and community structure, and changes in functional composition. The strength of these relationships, however, depended on the spatial scale and season at which they were considered. Such spatio-temporal effect suggests that urbanisation may dampen the natural seasonal variation of the gut microbiota observed in more pristine habitats, potentially influencing the fitness of urban organisms.

Resources are a core currency of species interactions and ecology in general (e.g., think of food webs or competition). Within parasite-infected hosts, resources are divided among the competing demands of host immunity and growth as well as parasite reproduction and growth. Effects of resources on immune responses are increasingly understood at the cellular level (e.g., metabolic predictors of effector function), but there has been limited consideration of how these effects scale up to affect individual energetic regimes (e.g., allocation trade-offs), susceptibility to infection, and feeding behavior (e.g., responses to local resource quality and quantity). We experimentally rewilded laboratory mice (strain C57BL/6) in semi-natural enclosures to investigate the effects of dietary protein and gastrointestinal nematode (Trichuris muris) infection on individual-level immunity, activity, and behavior. The scale and realism of this field experiment, as well as the multiple physiological assays developed for laboratory mice, enabled us to detect costs, trade-offs, and potential compensatory mechanisms that mice employ to battle infection under different resource conditions. We found that mice on a low-protein diet spent more time feeding, which led to higher body fat stores (i.e., concentration of a satiety hormone, leptin) and altered metabolite profiles, but which did not fully compensate for the effects of poor nutrition on albumin or immune defenses. Specifically, immune defenses measured as interleukin 13 (IL13) (a primary cytokine coordinating defense against T. muris) and as T. muris-specific IgG1 titers were lower in mice on the low-protein diet. However, these reduced defenses did not result in higher worm counts in mice with poorer diets. The lab mice, living outside for the first time in thousands of generations, also consumed at least 26 wild plant species occurring in the enclosures, and DNA metabarcoding revealed that the consumption of different wild foods may be associated with differences in leptin concentrations. When individual foraging behavior was accounted for, worm infection significantly reduced rates of host weight gain. Housing laboratory mice in outdoor enclosures provided new insights into the resource costs of immune defense to helminth infection and how hosts modify their behavior to compensate for those costs.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Compensatory feeding | DNA metabarcoding | Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolite profiling | Resource-immune trade-offs | Rewilding mice | Trichuris muris","21100229161","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","562","8","DEC",NA,"1914",NA,NA,2018

Svalbard’s vascular plant flora is well known, and a cold climate enhances preservation of eDNA in soils. Thus, Svalbard plant communities are excellent systems for addressing the representation of plant eDNA in soil samples. In two valleys in the inner fjord region of Spitsbergen, we carried out detailed vegetation surveys of circular plots up to a 4-m radius. One or three near-surface soil samples from each plot were used for extraction and metabarcoding of soil-derived eDNA. Use of PCR replicates and appropriate filtering, plus a relevant reference metabarcode catalogue, provided taxon lists that reflected the local flora. There was high concordance between taxa recorded in plot vegetation and those in the eDNA, but floristic diversity was under-sampled, even at the scale of a 1-m radius plot. Most detected taxa grew within < 0.5-1.0 m of the sampling point. Taxa present in vegetation but not in eDNA tended to occur further from the sampling point, and most had above-ground cover of < 5%. Soil-derived eDNA provides a highly local floristic signal, and this spatial constraint should be considered in sampling designs.

Deep sea lobsters are highly valued for seafood and provide the basis of important commercial fisheries in many parts of the world. Despite their economic significance, relatively little is known about their natural diets. Microscopic analyses of foregut content in some species have suffered from low taxonomic resolution, with many of the dietary items difficult to reliably identify as their tissue is easily digested. DNA metabarcoding has the potential to provide greater taxonomic resolution of the diet of the New Zealand scampi (Metanephrops challengeri) through the identification of gut contents, but a number of methodological concerns need to be overcome first to ensure optimum DNA metabarcoding results. In this study, a range of methodological parameters were tested to determine the optimum protocols for DNA metabarcoding, and provide a first view of M. challengeri diet. Several PCR protocols were tested, using two universal primer pairs targeting the 18S rRNA and COI genes, on DNA extracted from both frozen and ethanol preserved samples for both foregut and hindgut digesta. The selection of appropriate DNA polymerases, buffers and methods for reducing PCR inhibitors (including the use of BSA) were found to be critical. Amplification from frozen or ethanol preserved gut contents appeared similarly dependable. The COI gene was found to be more effective than 18S rRNA gene for identifying large eukaryotic taxa from the digesta; however, it was less successfully amplified. The 18S rRNA gene was more easily amplified, but identified mostly smaller marine organisms such as plankton and parasites. This preliminary analysis of the diet of M. challengeri identified a range of species (13,541 reads identified as diet), which included the ghost shark (Hydrolagus novaezealandiae), silver warehou (Seriolella punctata), tall sea pen (Funiculina quadrangularis) and the salp (Ihlea racovitzai), suggesting that they have a varied diet, with a high reliance on scavenging a diverse range of pelagic and benthic species from the seafloor.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","18S rRNA | COI | Database analysis | Diet | DNA polymerase | Metabarcoding | Metanephrops challengeri | New Zealand scampi | Next generation sequencing | PCR inhibition","21100239256","undefined","Ministry for Business Innovation and Employment","1","TRUE","567","2018","9",NA,"e5641",NA,NA,2018

Biodiversity assessment of marine hard-bottom communities is hindered by the high diversity and size-ranges of the organisms present. Wedeveloped aDNAmetabarcoding protocol for biodiversity characterization of structurally complex natural marine hardbottom communities. We used two molecular markers: the ``Leray fragment'' of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI), for which a novel primer set was developed, and the V7 region of the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S). Eight different shallow marine littoral communities from two National Parks in Spain (one in the Atlantic Ocean and another in the Mediterranean Sea) were studied. Samples were sieved into three size fractions from where DNA was extracted separately. Bayesian clustering was used for delimiting molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) and custom reference databases were constructed for taxonomic assignment. Despite applying stringent filters, we found high values for MOTU richness (2,510 and 9,679 MOTUs with 18S and COI, respectively), suggesting that these communities host a large amount of yet undescribed eukaryotic biodiversity. Significant gaps are still found in sequence reference databases, which currently prevent the complete taxonomic assignment of the detected sequences. In our dataset, 85% of 18S MOTUs and 64% of COI MOTUs could be identified to phylum or lower taxonomic level. Nevertheless, those unassigned were mostly rare MOTUs with low numbers of reads, and assigned MOTUs comprised over 90% of the total sequence reads. The identification rate might be significantly improved in the future, as reference databases are further completed. Our results show that marine metabarcoding, currently applied mostly to plankton or sediments, can be adapted to structurally complex hard bottom samples. Thus, eukaryotic metabarcoding emerges as a robust, fast, objective and affordable method to comprehensively characterize the diversity of marine benthic communities dominated by macroscopic seaweeds and colonial or modular sessile metazoans.

Background: DNA metabarcoding is used to generate species composition data for entire communities. However, sequencing errors in high-throughput sequencing instruments are fairly common, usually requiring reads to be clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), losing information on intraspecific diversity in the process. While Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) haplotype information is limited in resolving intraspecific diversity it is nevertheless often useful e.g. in a phylogeographic context, helping to formulate hypotheses on taxon distribution and dispersal. Methods: This study combines sequence denoising strategies, normally applied in microbial research, with additional abundance-based filtering to extract haplotype information from freshwater macroinvertebrate metabarcoding datasets. This novel approach was added to the R package ""JAMP"" and can be applied to COI amplicon datasets.We tested our haplotyping method by sequencing (i) a single-species mock community composed of 31 individuals with 15 different haplotypes spanning three orders of magnitude in biomass and (ii) 18 monitoring samples each amplified with four different primer sets and two PCR replicates. Results: We detected all 15 haplotypes of the single specimens in the mock community with relaxed filtering and denoising settings. However, up to 480 additional unexpected haplotypes remained in both replicates. Rigorous filtering removes most unexpected haplotypes, but also can discard expected haplotypes mainly from the small specimens. In the monitoring samples, the different primer sets detected 177-200 OTUs, each containing an average of 2.40-3.30 haplotypes per OTU. The derived intraspecific diversity data showed population structures that were consistent between replicates and similar between primer pairs but resolution depended on the primer length. A closer look at abundant taxa in the dataset revealed various population genetic patterns, e.g. the stonefly Taeniopteryx nebulosa and the caddisfly Hydropsyche pellucidula showed a distinct north-south cline with respect to haplotype distribution, while the beetle Oulimnius tuberculatus and the isopod Asellus aquaticus displayed no clear population pattern but differed in genetic diversity. Discussion: We developed a strategy to infer intraspecific genetic diversity from bulk invertebrate metabarcoding data. It needs to be stressed that at this point this metabarcoding-informed haplotyping is not capable of capturing the full diversity present in such samples, due to variation in specimen size, primer bias and loss of sequence variants with low abundance. Nevertheless, for a high number of species intraspecific diversity was recovered, identifying potentially isolated populations and taxa for further more detailed phylogeographic investigation.While we are currently lacking large-scale metabarcoding datasets to fully take advantage of our new approach, metabarcoding-informed haplotyping holds great promise for biomonitoring efforts that not only seek information about species diversity but also underlying genetic diversity.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","CO1 | Ecosystem assessment | Exact sequence variant | Haplotyping | High-throughput sequencing | Metabarcoding | Population genetics","21100239256","CA15219","Canada First Research Excellence Fund","1","TRUE","570","2018","4",NA,"4644",NA,NA,2018

Uncovering the complexities of trophic and metabolic interactions among microorganisms is essential for the understanding of marine biogeochemical cycling and modelling climate-driven ecosystem shifts. High-throughput DNA sequencing methods provide valuable tools for examining these complex interactions, although this remains challenging, as many microorganisms are difficult to isolate, identify and culture. We use two species of planktonic foraminifera from the climatically susceptible, palaeoceanographically important genus Neogloboquadrina, as ideal test microorganisms for the application of 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. Neogloboquadrina dutertrei and Neogloboquadrina incompta were collected from the California Current and subjected to either 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding, fluorescence microscopy, or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate their species-specific trophic interactions and potential symbiotic associations. 53–99% of 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from two specimens of N. dutertrei were assigned to a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) from a chloroplast of the phylum Stramenopile. TEM observations confirmed the presence of numerous intact coccoid algae within the host cell, consistent with algal symbionts. Based on sequence data and observed ultrastructure, we taxonomically assign the putative algal symbionts to Pelagophyceae and not Chrysophyceae, as previously reported in this species. In addition, our data shows that N. dutertrei feeds on protists within particulate organic matter (POM), but not on bacteria as a major food source. In total contrast, of OTUs recovered from three N. incompta specimens, 83–95% were assigned to bacterial classes Alteromonadales and Vibrionales of the order Gammaproteobacteria. TEM demonstrates that these bacteria are a food source, not putative symbionts. Contrary to the current view that non-spinose foraminifera are predominantly herbivorous, neither N. dutertrei nor N. incompta contained significant numbers of phytoplankton OTUs. We present an alternative view of their trophic interactions and discuss these results within the context of modelling global planktonic foraminiferal abundances in response to high-latitude climate change.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"10600153309","OCE-1261519","Daphne Jackson Trust","1","TRUE","571","13","1","29377905","e0191653","JSC",NA,2018

Research on the relationship between changes in the gut microbiota and human disease, including AIDS, is a growing field. However, studies on the eukaryotic component of the intestinal microbiota have just begun and have not yet been conducted in HIV-infected patients. Moreover, eukaryotic community profiling is influenced by the use of different methodologies at each step of culture-independent techniques. Herein, initially, four DNA extraction protocols were compared to test the efficiency of each method in recovering eukaryotic DNA from fecal samples. Our results revealed that recovering eukaryotic components from fecal samples differs significantly among DNA extraction methods. Subsequently, the composition of the intestinal eukaryotic microbiota was evaluated in HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers through clone sequencing, high-throughput sequencing of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers 1 (ITS1) and 2 (ITS2) ampli-cons and real-time PCRs. Our results revealed that not only richness (Chao-1 index) and alpha diversity (Shannon diversity) differ between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, depending on the molecular strategy used, but also the global eukaryotic community composition, with little overlapping taxa found between techniques. Moreover, our results based on cloning libraries and ITS1/ITS2 metabarcoding sequencing showed significant differences in fungal composition between HIV-infected patients and healthy volunteers, but without distinct clusters separating the two groups. Malassezia restricta was significantly more prevalent in fecal samples of HIV-infected patients, according to cloning libraries, whereas operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were significantly more abundant in fecal samples of HIV-infected patients compared to healthy subjects in both ITS subregions. Finally, real-time PCR showed the presence of Microsporidia, Giardia lamblia, Blastocystis and Hymenolepis diminuta in different proportions in fecal samples from HIV patients as compared to healthy individuals. Our work revealed that the use of different sequencing approaches can impact the perceived eukaryotic diversity results of the human gut. We also provide a more comprehensive view of the eukaryotic community in the gut of HIV-infected patients through the complementarity of the different molecular techniques used. Combining these various methodologies may provide a gold standard for a more complete characterization of the eukaryotic microbiome in future studies.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","10",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","572","13","1","29385188","e0191913",NA,NA,2018

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Vector-borne diseases are a major health burden, yet factors affecting their spread are only partially understood. For example, microbial symbionts can impact mosquito reproduction, survival, and vectorial capacity, and hence affect disease transmission. Nonetheless, current knowledge of mosquito-associated microbial communities is limited. To characterize the bacterial and eukaryotic microbial communities of multiple vector species collected from different habitat types in disease endemic areas, we employed next-generation 454 pyrosequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon libraries, also known as metabarcoding. We investigated pooled whole adult mosquitoes of three medically important vectors, Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus, collected from different habitats across central Thailand where we previously characterized mosquito diversity. Our results indicate that diversity within the mosquito microbiota is low, with the majority of microbes assigned to one or a few taxa. Two of the most common eukaryotic and bacterial genera recovered (Ascogregarina and Wolbachia, respectively) are known mosquito endosymbionts with potentially parasitic and long evolutionary relationships with their hosts. Patterns of microbial composition and diversity appeared to differ by both vector species and habitat for a given species, although high variability between samples suggests a strong stochastic element to microbiota assembly. In general, our findings suggest that multiple factors, such as habitat condition and mosquito species identity, may influence overall microbial community composition, and thus provide a basis for further investigations into the interactions between vectors, their microbial communities, and human-impacted landscapes that may ultimately affect vector-borne disease risk.","10","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","biodiversity | metabarcoding | microbiota | mosquito | vector | vector-borne diseases","21100264002","P20RR018727","University of Hawai'i","1","TRUE","573","8","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Moreover, it starts from small amounts of input fecal material, useful in investigation on elusive and vulnerable species.

We explore how decisions regarding study design, laboratory set-up, and bioinformatic processing affect the final results, and provide guidelines for reliable study of environmental samples. We evaluate the performance of four primer sets targeting COI and 16S regions characterizing arthropod diversity in bat faecal samples, and investigate how metabarcoding results are affected by parameters including: (1) number of PCR replicates per sample, (2) sequencing depth, (3) PCR replicate processing strategy (i.e. either additively, by combining the sequences obtained from the PCR replicates, or restrictively, by only retaining sequences that occur in multiple PCR replicates for each sample), (4) minimum copy number for sequences to be retained, (5) chimera removal, and (6) similarity thresholds for Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) clustering. Lastly, we measure within- and between-taxa dissimilarities when using sequences from public databases to determine the most appropriate thresholds for OTU clustering and taxonomy assignment. Our results show that the use of multiple primer sets reduces taxonomic biases and increases taxonomic coverage. Taxonomic profiles resulting from each primer set are principally affected by how many PCR replicates are carried out per sample and how sequences are filtered across them, the sequence copy number threshold and the OTU clustering threshold. We also report considerable diversity differences between PCR replicates from each sample. Sequencing depth increases the dissimilarity between PCR replicates unless the bioinformatic strategies to remove allegedly artefactual sequences are adjusted according to the number of analysed sequences. Finally, we show that the appropriate identity thresholds for OTU clustering and taxonomy assignment differ between markers. Metabarcoding of complex environmental samples ideally requires (1) investigation of whether more than one primer sets targeting the same taxonomic group is needed to offset primer biases, (2) more than one PCR replicate per sample, (3) bioinformatic processing of sequences that balance diversity detection with removal of artefactual sequences, and (4) empirical selection of OTU clustering and taxonomy assignment thresholds tailored to each marker and the obtained taxa.","51","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","biodiversity assessment | environmental DNA | faecal samples | high throughput sequencing | metabarcoding primers | molecular diet analyses | operational taxonomic unit | PCR replicates | primer bias | taxonomic assignment","21100217611","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","575","9","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

We aimed to explore the use of metabarcoding, a new, non-invasive tool to survey the parasite assemblages in frogs in different environments facing different levels of anthropogenic pressure. We collected fecal samples from frogs across three different transects in Ranomafana National Park, located in southeastern Madagascar, and then used the 18S metabarcoding technique to identify nematode species from the collected fecal samples.

However, no genetic marker gives sufficient performance across all the biological kingdoms, hampering studies of taxonomic diversity in many groups of organisms. This has led to the adoption of a range of genetic markers for DNA metabarcoding.

Background. Knowledge on the globally outstanding Amazonian biodiversity and its environmental determinants stems almost exclusively from aboveground organisms, notably plants. In contrast, the environmental factors and habitat preferences that drive diversity patterns for micro-organisms in the ground remain elusive, despite the fact that micro-organisms constitute the overwhelming majority of life forms in any given location, in terms of both diversity and abundance. Here we address how the diversity and community turnover of operational taxonomic units (OTU) of organisms in soil and litter respond to soil physicochemical properties; whether OTU diversities and community composition in soil and litter are correlated with each other; and whether they respond in a similar way to soil properties. Methods. We used recently inferred OTUs from high-throughput metabarcoding of the 16S (prokaryotes) and 18S (eukaryotes) genes to estimate OTU diversity (OTU richness and effective number of OTUs) and community composition for prokaryotes and eukaryotes in soil and litter across four localities in Brazilian Amazonia. All analyses were run separately for prokaryote and eukaryote OTUs, and for each group using both presence-absence and abundance data. Combining these with novel data on soil chemical and physical properties, we identify abiotic correlates of soil and litter organism diversity and community structure using regression, ordination, and variance partitioning analysis. Results. Soil organic carbon content was the strongest factor explaining OTU diversity (negative correlation) and pH was the strongest factor explaining community turnover for prokaryotes and eukaryotes in both soil and litter. We found significant effects also for other soil variables, including both chemical and physical properties. The correlation between OTU diversity in litter and in soil was non-significant for eukaryotes and weak for prokaryotes. The community compositions of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes were more separated among habitat types (terra-firme, várzea, igapó and campina) than between substrates (soil and litter). Discussion. In spite of the limited sampling (four localities, 39 plots), our results provide a broad-scale view of the physical and chemical correlations of soil and litter biodiversity in a longitudinal transect across the world’s largest rainforest. Our methods help to understand links between soil properties, OTU diversity patterns, and community composition and turnover. The lack of strong correlation between OTU diversity in litter and in soil suggests independence of diversity drives of these substrates and highlights the importance of including both measures in biodiversity assessments. Massive sequencing of soil and litter samples holds the potential to complement traditional biological inventories in advancing our understanding of the factors affecting tropical diversity.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Brazil | Eukaryotes | Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) | Prokaryotes | Rainforest | Soil microorganisms","21100239256","FP/2007-2013","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico","1","TRUE","579","2018","9",NA,"e5661",NA,NA,2018

We produced a comprehensive arthropod COI amplicon dataset including annotated arthropod COI sequences and COI sequences extracted from arthropod whole mitochondrion genomes, the latter of which provided the only source of representation for Zoraptera, Callipodida and Holothyrida. The database contains extracted sequences of the target amplicon from all major arthropod clades, including all insect orders, all arthropod classes and Onychophora, Tardigrada and Mollusca outgroups. During curation, we extracted the COI region of interest from approximately 81 percent of the input sequences, corresponding to 73 percent of the genus-level diversity found in the input data. Further, our analysis revealed a high degree of sequence redundancy within the NCBI nucleotide database, with a mean of approximately 11 sequence entries per species in the input data. The curated, low-redundancy database is included in the Metaxa2 sequence classification software (http://microbiology.se/software/metaxa2/). Using this database with the Metaxa2 classifier, we performed a cross-validation analysis to characterize the relationship between the Metaxa2 reliability score, an estimate of classification confidence, and classification error probability. We used this analysis to select a reliability score threshold which minimized error.

In this study, we test the suitability of a rapid non-destructiveDNAextraction method for metabarcoding of freshwater invertebrate samples. Results. This method resulted in detection of taxa from many taxonomic groups, comparable to results obtained with two other tissue-based extraction methods. Most taxa could also be successfully used for subsequent individual-based DNA barcoding and taxonomic identification. The method was successfully applied to field-collected invertebrate samples stored for taxonomic studies in 70% ethanol at room temperature, a commonly used storage method for freshwater samples.

Nucleic acid extracted from both crude homogenate and supernatant was used to amplify a 269-bp section of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) locus. Additionally, a 67-bp region of the RRV E2 gene was amplified from synthesized cDNA to screen for RRV. Amplicon sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiSeq, and bioinformatic analysis was performed using a DNA barcode database of Victorian mosquitoes. Metabarcoding successfully detected all mosquito species and RRV in every positive sample tested. The limits of species detection were also examined by screening a pool of 1000 individuals, successfully identifying the species and RRV from a single mosquito. The primers used for amplification, number of PCR cycles and total number of individuals present all have effects on the quantification of species in mixed bulk samples. Based on the results, a number of recommendations for future metabarcoding studies are presented. Overall, metabarcoding shows great promise for providing a new alternative approach to screening large insect surveillance trap catches.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","bulk sample | Culicidae | cytochrome c oxidase subunit I | DNA barcoding | pooled samples | virus","11700154306","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","582","18","1","28417591",NA,NA,NA,2018

Current methodology for surveys of (macro)invertebrates uses coarse taxonomic identification where species-level resolution is difficult to obtain. Next-generation sequencing of entire assemblages (metabarcoding) provides a new approach for species detection, but requires further validation. We used metabarcoding of invertebrate assemblages with two fragments of the cox1 “barcode” and partial nuclear ribosomal (SSU) genes, to assess the effects of a pesticide spill in the River Kennet (southern England). Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) recovery was tested under 72 parameters (read denoising, filtering, pair merging and clustering). Similar taxonomic profiles were obtained under a broad range of parameters. The SSU marker recovered Platyhelminthes and Nematoda, missed by cox1, while Rotifera were only amplified with cox1. A reference set was created from all available barcode entries for Arthropoda in the BOLD database and clustered into OTUs. The River Kennet metabarcoding produced matches to 207 of these reference OTUs, five times the number of species recognized with morphological monitoring. The increase was due to the following: greater taxonomic resolution (e.g., splitting a single morphotaxon “Chironomidae” into 55 named OTUs); splitting of Linnaean binomials into multiple molecular OTUs; and the use of a filtration-flotation protocol for extraction of minute specimens (meiofauna). Community analyses revealed strong differences between “impacted” vs. “control” samples, detectable with each gene marker, for each major taxonomic group, and for meio- and macrofaunal samples separately. Thus, highly resolved taxonomic data can be extracted at a fraction of the time and cost of traditional nonmolecular methods, opening new avenues for freshwater invertebrate biodiversity monitoring and molecular ecology.","9","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","biomonitoring | community ecology | DNA barcoding | freshwater ecosystems | invertebrates","20297","NE/M021955","National Eye Research Centre","0","FALSE","584","27","1","29113023",NA,NA,NA,2018

Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species descended from both domestic swine and Eurasian wild boar that was introduced to North America during the early 1500s. Wild pigs have since become the most abundant free-ranging exotic ungulate in the United States. Large and ever-increasing populations of wild pigs negatively impact agriculture, sport hunting, and native ecosystems with costs estimated to exceed $1.5 billion/year within the United States. Wild pigs are recognized as generalist feeders, able to exploit a broad array of locally available food resources, yet their feeding behaviors remain poorly understood as partially digested material is often unidentifiable through traditional stomach content analyses. To overcome the limitation of stomach content analyses, we developed a DNA sequencing-based protocol to describe the plant and animal diet composition of wild pigs. Additionally, we developed and evaluated blocking primers to reduce the amplification and sequencing of host DNA, thus providing greater returns of sequences from diet items. We demonstrate that the use of blocking primers produces significantly more sequencing reads per sample from diet items, which increases the robustness of ascertaining animal diet composition with molecular tools. Further, we show that the overall plant and animal diet composition is significantly different between the three areas sampled, demonstrating this approach is suitable for describing differences in diet composition among the locations.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","blocking primer | CO1 | diet | feral swine | metabarcoding | trnL","21100264002","undefined","U.S. Department of Agriculture","1","TRUE","585","8","1",NA,NA,"USDA",NA,2018

Streams and their surrounding riparian habitats are linked by reciprocal exchanges of insect prey essential to both aquatic and terrestrial consumers. Aquatic insects comprise a large proportion of total prey in riparian habitats and are opportunistically exploited by terrestrial insectivores; however, several species of songbirds are known to preferentially target aquatic prey via specialized foraging strategies. For these songbirds, reduced availability of aquatic insects via stream acidification may result in compensatory changes in provisioning during the nesting period, thereby influencing both adult and nestling diet composition. In this study, we used DNA metabarcoding to test the hypothesis that an obligate riparian Neotropical migratory songbird, the Louisiana Waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla), expands its diet to compensate for the loss of preferred aquatic prey taxa (primarily pollution-sensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) as a result of stream acidification. Our results revealed that both adult and nestling waterthrush exhibited an increase in dietary richness and niche breadth resulting from the consumption of terrestrial prey taxa in acidified riparian habitats. In contrast, compensatory dietary shifts were not observed in syntopic Neotropical migrant species known to primarily provision terrestrial prey taxa. In addition to providing support for our hypothesis that waterthrush compensate for stream acidification and aquatic prey limitations by expanding their diet, our findings highlight the vulnerability of Louisiana Waterthrush to anthropogenic disturbances that compromise stream quality or reduce the availability of pollution-sensitive aquatic insects.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","DNA metabarcoding | EPT | Louisiana Waterthrush | Macroinvertebrates | Next-generation sequencing | Resource subsidies","21100239256","DEB-1349870","American Ornithological Society","1","TRUE","591","2018","7",NA,"e5141",NA,NA,2018

Background: Intense landscaping often alters the plant composition in urban areas. Knowing which plant species that pollinators are visiting in urban areas is necessary for understanding how landscaping impacts biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The cave nectar bat, Eonycteris spelaea, is an important pollinator for many plants and is often recorded in human-dominated habitats. Previous studies of the diet of E. spelaea relied on morphological identification of pollen grains found in faeces and on the body of bats and by necessity disregarded other forms of digested plant material present in the faeces (i.e., plant juice and remnants). The main objective of this study was to examine the diet of the nectarivorous bat, E. spelaea, roosting in an urban cave at Batu Caves, Peninsular Malaysia by identifying the plant material present in the faeces of bats using DNA metabarcoding. Methods: Faeces were collected under the roost of E. spelaea once a week from December 2015 to March 2016. Plant DNA was extracted from the faeces, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified at ITS2 and rbcL regions and mass sequenced. The resultant plant operational taxonomic units were searched against NCBI GenBank for identification. Results: A total of 55 species of plants were detected from faeces of E. spelaea including Artocarpus heterophyllus, Duabanga grandiflora and Musa spp. which are likely to be important food resources for the cave nectar bat. Discussion: Many native plant species that had not been reported in previous dietary studies of E. spelaea were detected in this study including Bauhinia strychnoidea and Urophyllum leucophlaeum, suggesting that E. spelaea remains a crucial pollinator for these plants even in highly disturbed habitats. The detection of many introduced plant species in the bat faeces indicates that E. spelaea are exploiting them, particularly Xanthostemon chrysanthus, as food resources in urban area. Commercial food crops were detected from all of the faecal samples, suggesting that E. spelaea feed predominantly on the crops particularly jackfruit and banana and play a significant role in pollination of economically important plants. Ferns and figs were also detected in the faeces of E. spelaea suggesting future research avenues to determine whether the 'specialised nectarivorous' E. spelaea feed opportunistically on other parts of plants.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Bats | DNA metabarcoding | Eonycteris spelaea | ITS2 | Nectarivory | Peninsular Malaysia | Plants | RbcL | Trophic interactions | Urbanisation","21100239256","Asia59-16","National Geographic Society","1","TRUE","593","2018","3",NA,"e4572",NA,NA,2018

The ability to scale up is made possible by the reduced hands-on time and cost per sample provided by the newest kits, platforms and software tools. Results gleaned from broad-scale monitoring will provide opportunities to address key scientific questions linked to biodiversity and its dynamics across time and space as well as being more relevant for policymakers, enabling science-based decision-making, and provide a greater socio-economic impact.

Switches to locally adapted algae have been proposed to be an adaptive strategy of lichen-forming fungi to cope with environmental change. However, it is unclear how lichen photobionts respond to environmental gradients, and whether they play a role in determining the fungal host's upper and lower elevational limits. Deep-coverage Illumina DNA metabarcoding was used to track changes in the community composition of Trebouxia algae associated with two phylogenetically closely related, but ecologically divergent fungal hosts along a steep altitudinal gradient in the Mediterranean region. We detected the presence of multiple Trebouxia species in the majority of thalli. Both altitude and host genetic identity were strong predictors of photobiont community assembly in these two species. The predominantly clonally dispersing fungus showed stronger altitudinal structuring of photobiont communities than the sexually reproducing host. Elevation ranges of the host were not limited by the lack of compatible photobionts. Our study sheds light on the processes guiding the formation and distribution of specific fungal–algal combinations in the lichen symbiosis. The effect of environmental filtering acting on both symbiotic partners appears to shape the distribution of lichens.","11","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","altitude | climate change | elevation gradient | metabarcoding | Next-generation sequencing (NGS) | range limits | symbiosis | Trebouxia","19908","CGL2013-42498-P","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación","1","TRUE","596","217","1","28892165",NA,NA,NA,2018

High-throughput studies of microbial communities suggest that Archaea are a widespread component of microbial diversity in various ecosystems. However, proper quantification of archaeal diversity and community ecology remains limited, as sequence coverage of Archaea is usually low owing to the inability of available prokaryotic primers to efficiently amplify archaeal compared to bacterial rRNA genes. To improve identification and quantification of Archaea, we designed and validated the utility of several primer pairs to efficiently amplify archaeal 16S rRNA genes based on up-to-date reference genes. We demonstrate that several of these primer pairs amplify phylogenetically diverse Archaea with high sequencing coverage, outperforming commonly used primers. Based on comparing the resulting long 16S rRNA gene fragments with public databases from all habitats, we found several novel family- to phylum-level archaeal taxa from topsoil and surface water. Our results suggest that archaeal diversity has been largely overlooked due to the limitations of available primers, and that improved primer pairs enable to estimate archaeal diversity more accurately.","3","Journal","undefined",NA,"100","5",NA,"19700180907","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","597",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

PCR amplification bias is a well-known problem in metagenomic analysis of arthropod communities. In contrast, variation of DNA degradation rates is a largely neglected source of bias. Differential degradation of DNA molecules could cause underrepresentation of taxa in a community sequencing sample. Arthropods are often collected by passive sampling devices, like malaise traps. Specimens in such a trap are exposed to varying periods of suboptimal storage and possibly different rates of DNA degradation. Degradation bias could thus be a significant issue, skewing diversity estimates. Here, we estimate the effect of differential DNA degradation on the recovery of community diversity of Hawaiian arthropods and their associated microbiota. We use a simple DNA size selection protocol to test for degradation bias in mock communities, as well as passively collected samples from actual Malaise traps. We compare the effect of DNA degradation to that of varying PCR conditions, including primer choice, annealing temperature and cycle number.

Plant strategies for soil nutrient uptake have the potential to strongly influence plant–microbiota interactions, due to the competition between plants and microorganisms for soil nutrient acquisition and/or conservation. In the present study, we investigate whether these plant strategies could influence rhizosphere microbial activities via root exudation, and contribute to the microbiota diversification of active bacterial communities colonizing the root-adhering soil (RAS) and inhabiting the root tissues. We applied a DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) approach to six grass species distributed along a gradient of plant nutrient resource strategies, from conservative species, characterized by low nitrogen (N) uptake, a long lifespans and low root exudation level, to exploitative species, characterized by high rates of photosynthesis, rapid rates of N uptake and high root exudation level. We analyzed their (i) associated microbiota composition involved in root exudate assimilation and soil organic matter (SOM) degradation by 16S-rRNA-based metabarcoding. (ii) We determine the impact of root exudation level on microbial activities (denitrification and respiration) by gas chromatography. Measurement of microbial activities revealed an increase in denitrification and respiration activities for microbial communities colonizing the RAS of exploitative species. This increase of microbial activities results probably from a higher exudation rate and more diverse metabolites by exploitative plant species. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that plant nutrient resource strategies have a role in shaping active microbiota. We present evidence demonstrating that plant nutrient use strategies shape active microbiota involved in root exudate assimilation and SOM degradation via root exudation.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Active bacterial community | Denitrification | Microbial activities | Microbiota | Plant nutrient use strategies | Rhizosphere | Root exudation | Stable isotope probing (SIP)","5100152904","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","600","871",NA,NA,"1662",NA,NA,2018

However, there are a number of difficulties with sampling eDNA from such turbid water-bodies and it is often not feasible to rely on electrical tools in remote desert environments.

From nine vertebrate species expected in the water-bodies, four were detected visually, two via metabarcoding, and one via both methods. Difficulties filtering turbid water led to severe constraints, limiting the sampling protocol to only one sampling point per study site, which alone may largely explain why many of the expected vertebrate species were not detected. The amplification of human DNA using general vertebrate primers is also likely to have contributed to the low number of taxa identified.

We used high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) of the 18S ribosomal DNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) to characterise stomach contents of four myctophid and one bathylagid species collected at the southern extension of the Kerguelen Plateau (southern Kerguelen Axis), one of the most productive regions in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Diets of the four myctophid species were dominated by amphipods, euphausiids and copepods, whereas radiolarians and siphonophores contributed a much greater proportion of HTS reads for Bathylagus sp.

Size-based shifts in diet were apparent, with larger individuals of both bathylagid and myctophid species more likely to consume euphausiids, but we found little evidence for regional differences in diet composition for each species over the survey area.

Fire is used extensively in savannahs but little is known about how rhinos respond to burning. Our aim was to understand rhino responses to fire by studying habitat selection and foraging at multiple scales. We used resource selection functions and locations of 31 rhinos during 2014-2016 to study rhino habitat use in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Rhino selectivity was quantified by comparing forage consumption to plant species availability in randomly sampled vegetation plots; rhino diets were subsequently verified through DNA metabarcoding analysis of faecal samples. Rhino habitat use was a unimodal function of fire history, with highly occupied sites having fire frequencies of < 0.6 fires/year and maximum occupancy occurring at a fire frequency of 0.1 fires/year. Foraging stations had characteristic plant communities, with 17 species associated with rhino foraging. Rhinos were associated with, and disproportionately consumed, woody plants, forbs and legumes, all of which decreased in abundance with increasing fire frequency. In contrast to common management practices, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the current fire regime in the Serengeti negatively influences rhino habitat use and foraging and that frequent fire limits access of rhinos to preferred forage. We outline a conceptual model to guide managers and conservationists in the use of fire under variable habitat conditions.","0","Journal","undefined",NA,"100","8","Browser foraging | Diceros bicornis | fire frequency | habitat selection | resource selection functions | savannah | Serengeti National Park | spatial occupancy model","23287","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","607",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0030605318000388",2018

Additionally, we used samples from one site in Lake Michigan as a comparison to pathogen diversity and abundance in natural aquatic systems. Our results identified nine different groups of pathogens in the bait shop samples, including those that pose risks to both humans and fish species. Compared to wild sourced samples, the bait shops had higher relative abundance and greater taxonomic diversity. These findings suggest that the bait trade represents a potentially important pathway that could introduce and spread pathogens throughout the Great Lakes region. Improving pathogen screening and angler outreach should be used in combination to aid in preventing the future spread of high risk pathogens.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Environmental DNA | Metabarcoding | Microbes","21100239256","EPA-R5-GL2011–1",NA,"1","TRUE","608","2018","8",NA,"e5468",NA,NA,2018

Here we report on the broad distribution and prevalence of BBD in the Red Sea in addition to documenting a bleaching-associated outbreak of BBD with subsequent microbial community characterization of BBD microbial mats at this reef site in the southern central Red Sea. Coral colonies with BBD were found at roughly a third of our 22 survey sites with an overall prevalence of 0.04%. Nine coral genera were infected including Astreopora, Coelastrea, Dipsastraea, Gardineroseris, Goniopora, Montipora, Pavona, Platygyra, and Psammocora. For a southern central Red Sea outbreak site, overall prevalence was 40 times higher than baseline (1.7%). Differential susceptibility to BBD was apparent among coral genera with Dipsastraea (prevalence 6.1%), having more diseased colonies than was expected based on its abundance within transects. Analysis of the microbial community associated with the BBD mat showed that it is dominated by a consortium of cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. We detected the three main indicators for BBD (filamentous cyanobacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB)), with high similarity to BBD-associated microbes found worldwide. More specifically, the microbial consortium of BBD-diseased coral colonies in the Red Sea consisted of Oscillatoria sp. (cyanobacteria), Desulfovibrio sp. (SRB), and Arcobacter sp. (SOB).

To understand the implications of SWI, we need fundamental baseline information for floodplain biota from the South Alligator River, KNP, northern Australia, and informative data on how increased and prolonged exposure to salt is likely to shape the eukaryotic community. To assist in addressing these key knowledge gaps, we used amplicon sequencing to examine the composition of eukaryotic soil communities from the South Alligator River floodplain, an ecologically important area at the 'coalface' of sea-level rise. Samples were obtained from three river zones and three floodplain morphologies, capturing a wide range of habitats and episodic exposures to both saltwater and freshwater. We found that both the floodplain morphology and positioning along the river significantly influenced eukaryotic composition. However, the influence of these variables varied greatly among the floodplain morphologies, with correlative evidence suggesting that both salinity and pH played a dominant role in shaping communities within lower parts of the floodplain, with this being particularly evident in those regions subjected to major tidal influence (estuarine funnel and sinuous, and cuspate).","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Climate change | Flood morphology | Metabarcoding | River zone | Saltwater","27846","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","612","69","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018

Nowadays DNA meta-barcoding is a powerful instrument capable of quickly discovering the biodiversity of an environmental sample by integrating the DNA barcoding approach with High Throughput Sequencing technologies. It mainly consists of the parallel reading of informative genomic fragment/s able to discriminate living entities. Although this approach has been widely studied, it still needs optimization in some necessary steps requested in its advanced accomplishment. A fundamental element concerns the standardization of bioinformatic analyses pipelines. The aim of the present study was to underline a number of critical parameters of laboratory material preparation and taxonomic assignment pipelines in DNA meta-barcoding experiments using the cytochrome oxidase subunit-I (coxI) barcode region, known as a suitable molecular marker for animal species identification. We compared nine taxonomic assignment pipelines, including a custom in-house method, based on Hidden Markov Models. Moreover, we evaluated the potential influence of universal primers amplification bias in qPCR, as well as the correlation between GC content with taxonomic assignment results. The pipelines were tested on a community of known terrestrial invertebrates collected by pitfall traps from a chestnut forest in Italy. Although the present analysis was not exhaustive and needs additional investigation, our results suggest some potential improvements in laboratory material preparation and the introduction of additional parameters in taxonomic assignment pipelines. These include the correct setup of OTU clustering threshold, the calibration of GC content affecting sequencing quality and taxonomic classification, as well as the evaluation of PCR primers amplification bias on the final biodiversity pattern.

We tested whether such mammal-induced changes to a high Arctic plant community are reflected in the structure of other trophic levels. Specifically, we tested whether substantial vegetation changes following the experimental exclusion of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) altered the composition of the arthropod community and the predator–prey interactions therein. Overall, we found no impact of muskox exclusion on the arthropod community: the diversity and abundance of both arthropod predators (spiders) and of their prey were unaffected by muskox presence, and so was the qualitative and quantitative structure of predator–prey interactions. Hence, high Arctic arthropod communities seem highly resistant towards even large biotic changes in their habitat, which we attribute to the high connectance in the food web.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Araneae | Metabarcoding | Molecular diet analysis | Predator–prey","145678","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","617","14","5","29743265","20180054",NA,NA,2018

COI sequence records were available for 61.2% of North American genera and 72.4% of Insecta genera in public databases.

In CABIN, 85.4% of genera had COI sequence records, and 95.2% of genera occurring in >1% of samples were represented. Genera absent from CABIN tended to be uncommon or members of groups not routinely used for biomonitoring purposes. On average, 94.1% of genera in well-identified samples had associated sequence data. To leverage the full potential of genomics approaches, we must expand DNA-barcode reference libraries for poorly described components of freshwater food webs.

Public COI libraries are sufficiently populated to permit routine application of genomics tools in biomonitoring, and ongoing quality assurance/quality control should include re-evaluation as new COI reference sequences are added or taxonomic hierarchies change. Next, we must understand whether and how established biomonitoring approaches can capitalize on high-throughput sequencing tools. Biomonitoring approaches that use genomics data to facilitate structural and functional assessments are fertile ground for future investigation and will benefit from continued improvement of publicly available sequence libraries.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Biomonitoring | Biomonitoring 2.0 | COI | DNA metabarcoding | Genus | High-throughput sequencing | Identification | Invertebrates","21100297824","undefined","Environment and Climate Change Canada","0","FALSE","619","37","1",NA,NA,"ECCC",NA,2018

Ocean acidification significantly affects marine organisms in several ways, with complex interactions. Seaweeds might benefit from risingCO2 through increased photosynthesis and carbon acquisition, with subsequent higher growth rates. However, changes in seaweed chemistry due to increased CO2 may change the nutritional quality of tissue for grazers. In addition, organisms live in close association with a diverse microbiota, which can also be influenced by environmental changes, with feedback effects. As gut microbiomes are often linked to diet, changes in seaweed characteristics and associated microbiome can affect the gut microbiome of the grazer, with possible fitness consequences. In this study, we experimentally investigated the effects of acidification on the microbiome of the invasive brown seaweed Sargassum muticum and a native isopod consumer Synisoma nadejda. Both were exposed to ambient CO2 conditions (380 ppm, pH 8.16) and an acidification treatment (1,000 ppm, pH 7.86) for three weeks. Microbiome diversity and composition were determined using high-throughput sequencing of the variable regions V5-7 of 16S rRNA. We anticipated that as a result of acidification, the seaweed-associated bacterial community would change, leading to further changes in the gut microbiome of grazers. However, no significant effects of elevated CO2 on the overall bacterial community structure and composition were revealed in the seaweed. In contrast, significant changes were observed in the bacterial community of the grazer gut. Although the bacterial community of S. muticum as whole did not change, Oceanospirillales and Vibrionales (mainly Pseudoalteromonas) significantly increased their abundance in acidified conditions. The former, which uses organic matter compounds as its main source, may have opportunistically taken advantage of the possible increase of the C/N ratio in the seaweed under acidified conditions. Pseudoalteromonas, commonly associated to diseased seaweeds, suggesting that acidification may facilitate opportunistic/pathogenic bacteria. In the gut of S. nadejda, the bacterial genus Planctomycetia increased abundance under elevated CO2. This shift might be associated to changes in food (S. muticum) quality under acidification. Planctomycetia are slow-acting decomposers of algal polymers that could be providing the isopod with an elevated algal digestion and availability of inorganic compounds to compensate the shifted C/N ratio under acidification in their food. In conclusion, our results indicate that even after only three weeks of acidified conditions, bacterial communities associated to ungrazed seaweed and to an isopod grazer show specific, differential shifts in associated bacterial community. These have potential consequences for seaweed health (as shown in corals) and isopod food digestion. The observed changes in the gut microbiome of the grazer seem to reflect changes in the seaweed chemistry rather than its microbial composition.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Algae microbiomes | Grazer microbiomes | Invasive seaweeds | Metabarcoding | Ocean acidification | Sargassum muticum | Synisoma nadejda","21100239256","SFRH/BPD/63703/2009","Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia","1","TRUE","620","2018","3",NA,"e4377",NA,NA,2018

All rights reserved.  In the present work, we review the current knowledge on genesis, limnology and biodiversity of salt lakes distributed around the inner contour of Eastern Carpathian arc (Transylvanian Basin, Central Romania). Transylvanian salt lakes formed on ancient halite (NaCl) deposits following natural processes or quarrying activities. Most of these lakes are located in eastern (Sovata area), southern (Ocna Sibiului), and western (Turda-Cojocna) parts of the Transylvanian Basin, have small surfaces (0.1-4 ha), variable depths (2-100 m), are hypersaline (>10%, w/v, total salts, mainly NaCl) and permanently stratified. As consequence of steady salinity/density gradient, heat entrapment below surface layer (i.e., heliothermy) develops in several Transylvanian lakes. The physical and chemical water stratification is mirrored in the partition of plankton diversity. Lakes with less saline (2-10% salinity) water layers appear to harbor halotolerant representatives of phyto- (e.g., marine native Picochlorum spp. and Synechococcus spp.), zoo- (e.g., Moina salina), and bacterioplankton (e.g., Actinobacteria, Verrucomicobia), whereas halophilic plankton communities (e.g., green algae Dunaliella sp., brine shrimp Artemia sp., and members of Halobacteria class) dominate in the oxic surface of hypersaline (>10% salinity) lakes. Molecular approaches (e.g., PCR-DGGE, 16S rRNA gene-based clone libraries, and DNA metabarcoding) showed that the O 2 -depleted bottom brines of deep meromictic Transylvanian lakes are inhabited by known extremely halophilic anaerobes (e.g. sulfate-reducing Delta-Proteobacteria, fermenting Clostridia, methanogenic and polymer-degrading archaea) in addition to representatives of uncultured/unclassified prokaryotic lineages. Overall, the plankton communities thriving in saline Transylvanian lakes seem to drive full biogeochemical cycling of main elements. However, the trophic interactions (i.e., food web structure and energy flow) as well as impact of human activities and predicted climate changes are yet to be assessed in these unique ecosystems with little or no match to analogous salt lakes worldwide.","3","Journal","re","Review","100","11","Biodiversity | Halite | Halophilic | Hypersaline | Meromictic lake | Picophytoplankton | Zooplankton","29608","PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0546","Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice","1","TRUE","622","77","1",NA,NA,"CNCS",NA,2018

Background. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) accumulate in urban soils, and PAH contamination can change soil microbial community composition. Environmental microbiota is associated with human commensal microbiota, immune system and health. Therefore, studies investigating the degradation of PAHs, and the consequences of soil pollution on microbial communities in urban landscaping materials, are crucial. Methods. Four landscaping materials (organic matter 1, 2, 13 and 56%) were contaminated with PAHs commonly found at urban sites (phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene and benzo(b)fluoranthene) in PAH concentrations that reflect urban soils in Finland (2.4 µg g -1 soil dry weight). PAHs were analyzed initially and after 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Half-lives of PAHs were determined based on 12-weeks degradation. Bacterial communities were analyzed at 1 and 12 weeks after contamination using Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. Results. Half-lives ranged from 1.5 to 4.4 weeks for PAHs with relatively low molecular weights (phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene) in landscaping materials containing 1-2% organic matter. In contrast, in materials containing 13% and 56% organic matter, the half-lives ranged from 2.5 to 52 weeks. Shorter half-lives of phenanthrene and fluoranthene were thus associated with low organic matter content. The half-life of pyrene was inversely related to the relative abundance of Beta-, Delta- and Gammaproteobacteria, and diversity of Bacteroidetes and Betaprotebacteria. Compounds with higher molecular weights followed compound-specific patterns. Benzo(b)fluoranthene was resistant to degradation and half-life of chrysene was shorter when the relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria was high. Temporal microbiota changes involved increase in the relative abundance of Deltaproteobacteria and decrease in genera Flavobacterium and Rhodanobacter. Exposure to PAHs seems to adjust microbial community composition, particularly within class Beta- and Deltaproteobacteria. Conclusions. In this study, PAH degradation depended on the organic matter content and bacterial community composition of landscaping materials. Contamination seems to alter bacterial community composition in landscaping materials depending on material type. This alteration includes changes in bacterial phyla associated with human health and immune system. This may open new possibilities for managing urban environments by careful selection of landscaping materials, to benefit health and wellbeing.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Biodegradation | Health-associated bacteria | Human health | Microbial community composition | Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons | Urban pollution","21100239256","40333/14","European Environment Agency","1","TRUE","623","2018","3",NA,"e4508",NA,NA,2018

We can recover genetic information from organisms of all kinds using environmental sampling.

The technique is beginning to become a core tool for ecologists, environmental scientists, and biologists of many kinds, but the temporal resolution of eDNA sampling is often unclear, limiting the ecological interpretations of the resulting datasets. Here, in a temporally and spatially replicated field study using ca. 313 bp of eukaryotic COI mtDNA as a marker, we find that nearshore organismal communities are largely consistent across tides. Our findings suggest that nearshore eDNA from both benthic and planktonic taxa tends to be endogenous to the site and water mass sampled, rather than changing with each tidal cycle.

Diatoms are used routinely to assess pollution level in rivers and lakes. Current methods are based on identification by light microscopy, which is laborious. An alternative is to identify species based on short DNA fragments and High–Throughput Sequencing (HTS). However a potential limitation is the incomplete coverage of species in reference barcode libraries. Usually these libraries are compiled by isolating cells, before culturing and sequencing them, which is tedious and often unsuccessful. Here we propose the use of rbcL sequences from environmental samples analysed by HTS. We set several criteria to ensure good sequence quality and correspondence with the target species observed in microscopy: the sequence needed to be abundant in the sample, and with no insertions nor deletions or stop codon, phylogenetic neighbour taxa had to correspond to neighbour taxonomic taxa expected from morphological observations.

A holistic understanding of environmental communities is the new challenge of metagenomics. Accordingly, the amplicon-based or metabarcoding approach, largely applied to investigate bacterial microbiomes, is moving to the eukaryotic world too. Indeed, the analysis of metabarcoding data may provide a comprehensive assessment of both bacterial and eukaryotic composition in a variety of environments, including human body. In this respect, whereas hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA are the de facto standard barcode for bacteria, the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) of ribosomal RNA gene cluster has shown a high potential in discriminating eukaryotes at deep taxonomic levels. As metabarcoding data analysis rely on the availability of a well-curated barcode reference resource, a comprehensive collection of ITS1 sequences supplied with robust taxonomies, is highly needed.

The aim of our study was to quantify and compare methane emissions of both breeds under conditions of equal diet composition, environment and physiological stage (using heifers of the same age). The methanogen and bacterial communities were thoroughly investigated using metabarcoding to correlate taxonomic compositions with breed and methane emission levels. HF heifers had significantly higher absolute enteric methane emissions as compared to DMBB heifers. Methane production was positively correlated to the dry matter intake (DMI). Due to the significantly higher DMI and energy intake of HF heifers, methane yield per DMI was not significantly different between breeds. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between the gross feed efficiency (GFE) of both breeds, but the DMBB heifers demonstrated significantly lower CH4:CO2ratios (mole-to-mole ratio), suggesting a more efficient fermentation by the rumen microbial ecosystem. Although both breeds accommodated a common core of taxonomic groups, the bacterial communities also showed a breed specific composition due to differential abundance of specific species belonging to the main taxonomic groups and the presence of a few species of minor taxonomic groups that were significantly associated with one of both breeds.

The 11 investigated drillings have an open interval between 952 and 3432 m below the surface, with collected water temperatures ranging between 47 and 104 °C, these being the first microbial communities characterized in deep continental water deposits with outflow temperatures exceeding 80 °C. The abundances of bacterial 16S rRNA genes varied from approximately 105–106 mL-1 in the Pannonian to about 102–104 mL-1 in the Triassic aquifer. A 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding analysis revealed distinct microbial communities in the two water deposits, especially in the rare taxa composition. The Pannonian aquifer was dominated by the bacterial genera Hydrogenophilus and Thermodesulfobacterium, together with archaeal methanogens from the Methanosaeta and Methanothermobacter groups. Firmicutes was prevalent in the Triassic deposit with a large number of OTUs affiliated to Thermoanaerobacteriaceae, Thermacetogenium, and Desulfotomaculum. Species richness, evenness, and phylogenetic diversity increased alongside with the abundance of mesophiles, their presence in the Triassic aquifer being most probably caused by the refilling with large quantities of meteoric water in the Carpathian Mountains.

Coastal areas form the major habitat of brown macroalgae, photosynthetic multicellular eukaryotes that have great ecological value and industrial potential. Macroalgal growth, development, and physiology are influenced by the microbial community they accommodate. Studying the algal microbiome should thus increase our fundamental understanding of algal biology and may help to improve culturing efforts. Currently, a freshwater strain of the brown macroalga Ectocarpus subulatus is being developed as a model organism for brown macroalgal physiology and algal microbiome studies. It can grow in high and low salinities depending on which microbes it hosts. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are still unclear. Cultivation of Ectocarpus-associated bacteria is the first step toward the development of a model system for in vitro functional studies of brown macroalgal-bacterial interactions during abiotic stress. The main aim of the present study is thus to provide an extensive collection of cultivable E. subulatus-associated bacteria. To meet the variety of metabolic demands of Ectocarpus-associated bacteria, several isolation techniques were applied, i.e., direct plating and dilution-to-extinction cultivation techniques, each with chemically defined and undefined bacterial growth media. Algal tissue and algal growth media were directly used as inoculum, or they were pretreated with antibiotics, by filtration, or by digestion of algal cell walls. In total, 388 isolates were identified falling into 33 genera (46 distinct strains), of which Halomonas (Gammaproteobacteria), Bosea (Alphaproteobacteria), and Limnobacter (Betaproteobacteria) were the most abundant. Comparisons with 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding data showed that culturability in this study was remarkably high (~50%), although several cultivable strains were not detected or only present in extremely low abundance in the libraries. These undetected bacteria could be considered as part of the rare biosphere and they may form the basis for the temporal changes in the Ectocarpus microbiome.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Bacterial cultivation | Brown macroalgae | Dilution-to-extinction | Ectocarpus | Holobiont | Metabarcoding","21100226442","624575",NA,"1","TRUE","637","8","DEC",NA,"2456",NA,NA,2017

In this regard, we applied metabarcoding using the18S rDNA V9 region to samples collected throughout 1 yr from the Estuary of Bilbao (Basque Country, Spain) in order to characterize the annual cycle of the eukaryotic plankton community. We found clear patterns of spatial and seasonal environmental variability that drive the distribution and abundance of the plankton assemblage throughout the year, thus confirming results of previous studies using microscopic identification of the planktonic species.

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have been reported as a useful tool for the risk assessment and modeling of the pathways of dispersal of freshwater invasive alien species (IAS). Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a novel tool that can help detect IAS at their early stage of introduction and additionally improve the data available for a more efficient management. SDMs rely on presence and absence of the species in the study area to infer the predictors affecting species distributions. Presence is verified once a species is detected, but confirmation of absence can be problematic because this depends both on the detectability of the species and the sampling strategy. eDNA is a technique that presents higher detectability and accuracy in comparison to conventional sampling techniques, and can effectively differentiate between presence or absence of specific species or entire communities by using a barcoding or metabarcoding approach. However, a number of potential bias can be introduced during (i) sampling, (ii) amplification, (iii) sequencing, or (iv) through the usage of bioinformatics pipelines. Therefore, it is important to report and conduct the field and laboratory procedures in a consistent way, by (i) introducing eDNA independent observations, (ii) amplifying and sequencing control samples, (iii) achieving quality sequence reads by appropriate clean-up steps, (iv) controlling primer amplification preferences, (v) introducing PCR-free sequence capturing, (vi) estimating primer detection capabilities through controlled experiments and/or (vii) post-hoc introduction of ""site occupancy-detection models.""

Our goals were to improve the accuracy of diet estimates and extend understanding of feeding ecology by combining 2 scat-based methods of diet determination (hard-part identification and DNA-metabarcoding) with stable isotope measurements and individual behavioural data. We collected 98 scats on a northern fur seal breeding colony. We also tracked 20 females with biologgers, and took blood samples to determine d13C and d15N values as proxies for seal foraging habitat and diet. Results show that diet composition from hard-parts analysis corresponded well with DNA results, with DNA yielding a greater diversity of prey species at a finer taxonomic level. Overall, scat-based methods showed that seals mostly fed on neritic shelf-associated prey. Cluster analyses of combined hard-parts and DNA results however identified 2 diet groups, one mostly neritic and the other mostly pelagic. Stable isotopes and behavioural data revealed that 40% of seals fed in oceanic waters on pelagic prey. This is more than indicated by scat-based analyses, which are likely biased towards animals foraging closest to the colony and underestimate some dietary specializations within the population. Consequently, the combination of multiple methods for diet identification with at-sea tracking of individuals can help identify and quantify specialist groups within a population and provide a wider spatial and temporal ecological context for dietary analysis.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Biologging | Diet | DNA-metabarcoding | Foraging ecology | Hardparts identification | Northern fur seals | Stable isotopes | Telemetry","12169","undefined","North Pacific Research Board","1","TRUE","640","584",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Spatial and temporal collections provide important data on the distribution and dispersal of species. Regional-scale monitoring invariably involves hundreds of thousands of samples, the identification of which is costly in both time and money. In this respect, metabarcoding is increasingly seen as a viable alternative to traditional morphological identification, as it eliminates the taxonomic bottleneck previously impeding such work. Here, we assess whether terrestrial arthropods collected from 12 pitfall traps in two farms of a coffee (Coffea arabica L.) growing region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil could differentiate the two locations. We sequenced a portion of the cytochrome oxidase 1 region from minimally processed pools of samples and assessed inter-A nd intraspecific parameters across the two locations. Our sequencing was sufficient to circumscribe the overall diversity, which was characterized by few dominant taxa, principally small Coleoptera species and Collembola. Thirty-four operational taxonomic units were detected and of these, eight were present in significantly different quantities between the two farms. Analysis of community-wide Beta diversity grouped collections based on farm provenance. Moreover, haplotype-based analyses for a species of Xyleborus beetle showed that there is significant population genetic structuring between the two farms, suggesting limited dispersal. We conclude that metabarcoding can provide important management input and, considering the rapidly declining cost of sequencing, suggest that large-scale monitoring is now feasible and can identify both the taxa present as well as contribute information about genetic diversity of focal species.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","Beta diversity | insect dispersal | metabarcoding | next-generation sequencing","20311","0064-1035/2014","Agência Nacional de Energia Elétrica","0","FALSE","641","46","6","29069398",NA,NA,NA,2017

Microbiomes of full-scale seawater reverse osmosis membranes are complex and subject to variation within and between membrane units. The pre-existing bacterial communities of unused membranes before operation have been largely ignored in biofouling studies. This study is novel as unused membranes were used as a critical benchmark for comparison. Fouled seawater reverse osmosis membrane biofilm communities from an array of autopsied membrane samples, following a 7-year operational life-span in a full-scale desalination plant in Western Australia, were characterised by 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding using the bacterial primers 515F and 806R. Communities were then compared based on fouling severity and sampling location. Microbiomes of proteobacterial predominance were detected on control unused membranes. However, fouled membrane communities differed significantly from those on unused membranes, reflecting that operational conditions select specific bacteria on the membrane surface. On fouled membranes, Proteobacteria were also predominant but families differed from those on unused membranes, followed by Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes. Betaproteobacteria correlated with stable, mature and thick biofilms such as those in severely fouled membranes or samples from the feed end of the membrane unit, while Alpha and Gammaproteobacteria were predominantly found in biofilms on fouled but visually clean, and moderately fouled samples or those from reject ends of membrane units. Gammaproteobacteria predominated the thin, compact biofilms at the mid-feed end of membrane units. The study also supported the importance of Caulobacterales and glycosphingolipid-producing bacteria, namely Sphingomonadales, Rhizobiales and Sphingobacteriia, in primary attachment and biofilm recalcitrance.

Understanding interactions between herbivores and parasitoids is essential for successful biodiversity protection and monitoring and for biological pest control. Morphological identifications employ insect rearing and are complicated by insects' high diversity and crypsis. DNA barcoding has been successfully used in studies of host-parasitoid interactions as it can substantially increase the recovered real host-parasitoid diversity distorted by overlooked species complexes, or by species with slight morphological differences. However, this approach does not allow the simultaneous detection and identification of host(s) and parasitoid(s). Recently, high-throughput sequencing has shown high potential for surveying ecological communities and trophic interactions. Using mock samples comprising insect larvae and their parasitoids, we tested the potential of DNA metabarcoding for identifying individuals involved in host-parasitoid interactions to different taxonomic levels, and compared it to standard DNA barcoding and morphological approaches. For DNA metabarcoding, we targeted the standard barcoding marker cytochrome oxidase subunit I using highly degenerate primers, 2*300 bp sequencing on a MiSeq platform, and RTAX classification using paired-end reads. Additionally, using a large host-parasitoid dataset from a Central European floodplain forest, we assess the completeness and usability of a local reference library by confronting the number of Barcoding Index Numbers obtained by standard barcoding with the number of morphotypes. Overall, metabarcoding recovery was high, identifying 92.8% of the taxa present in mock samples, and identification success within individual taxonomic levels did not significantly differ among metabarcoding, standard barcoding, and morphology. Based on the current local reference library, 39.4% parasitoid and 90.7% host taxa were identified to the species level. DNA barcoding estimated higher parasitoid diversity than morphotyping, especially in groups with high level of crypsis. This study suggests the potential of metabarcoding for effectively recovering host-parasitoid diversity, together with more accurate identifications obtained from building reliable and comprehensive reference libraries, especially for parasitoids.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","643","12","12","29236697","0187803",NA,NA,2017

Amplicon based metabarcoding promises rapid and cost-efficient analyses of species composition. However, it is disputed whether abundance estimates can be derived from metabarcoding due to taxon specific PCR amplification biases. PCR-free approaches have been suggested to mitigate this problem, but come with considerable increases in workload and cost. Here, we analyze multilocus datasets of diverse arthropod communities, to evaluate whether amplification bias can be countered by (1) targeting loci with highly degenerate primers or conserved priming sites, (2) increasing PCR template concentration, (3) reducing PCR cycle number or (4) avoiding locus specific amplification by directly sequencing genomic DNA. Amplification bias is reduced considerably by degenerate primers or targeting amplicons with conserved priming sites. Surprisingly, a reduction of PCR cycles did not have a strong effect on amplification bias. The association of taxon abundance and read count was actually less predictable with fewer cycles. Even a complete exclusion of locus specific amplification did not exclude bias. Copy number variation of the target loci may be another explanation for read abundance differences between taxa, which would affect amplicon based and PCR free methods alike. As read abundance biases are taxon specific and predictable, the application of correction factors allows abundance estimates.","23","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"21100200805","NSF DEB 1241253","National Science Foundation","1","TRUE","644","7","1",NA,"17668",NA,NA,2017

Understanding how anthropogenic impacts on the landscape affect wildlife requires a knowledge of community assemblages. Species surveys are the first step in assessing community structure, and recent molecular applications such as metabarcoding and environmental DNA analyses have been proposed as an additional and complementary wildlife survey method. Here, we test eDNA metabarcoding as a survey tool to examine the potential use of uranium mine containment ponds as water sources by wildlife. We tested samples from surface water near mines and from one mine containment pond using two markers, 12S and 16S rRNA gene amplicons, to survey for vertebrate species. We recovered large numbers of sequence reads from taxa expected to be in the area and from less common or hard to observe taxa such as the tiger salamander and gray fox. Detection of these two species is of note because they were not observed in a previous species assessment, and tiger salamander DNA was found in the mine containment pond sample. We also found that sample concentration by centrifugation was a more efficient and more feasible method than filtration in these highly turbid surface waters. Ultimately, the use of eDNA metabarcoding could allow for a better understanding of the area's overall biodiversity and community composition as well as aid current ecotoxicological risk assessment work.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Biodiversity surveys | Ecotoxicology | Vertebrates | Wildlife attraction nuisance","6000187990","undefined","U.S. Geological Survey","1","TRUE","646","9","4",NA,"54",NA,NA,2017

Here, we investigated the potential of eDNA to inform on the breadth of biodiversity present in a tropical marine environment. Directly sequencing eDNA from seawater using a shotgun approach resulted in only 0.34% of 22.3 million reads assigning to eukaryotes, highlighting the inefficiency of this method for assessing eukaryotic diversity.

Our data also show that the best performing 'universal' PCR assay recovered only 44% of the eukaryotes identified across all assays, highlighting the need for multiple metabarcoding assays to catalogue biodiversity. Lastly, focusing on the fish genus Lethrinus, we recovered intra- and inter-specific haplotypes from seawater samples, illustrating that eDNA can be used to explore diversity beyond taxon identifications.

Understanding the influence of environmental change on zooplankton communities under field-conditions is hindered by traditional labor-intensive approaches that are prone to taxonomic and enumeration mistakes. Here, metabarcoding of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) region of mitochondrial DNA was used to characterize the genetic diversity of zooplankton. The species composition of zooplankton communities determined by metabarcoding was consistent with the results based on the traditional morphological approach. The spatial distribution of common species (frequency of occurrence >10 samples) by metabarcoding exhibited good agreement with morphological data. Furthermore, metabarcoding can clearly distinguish the composition of the zooplankton community between lake and river ecosystems. In general, rotifers were more abundant in riverine environments than lakes and reservoirs. Finally, the sequence read number of different taxonomic groups using metabarcoding was positively correlated with the zooplankton biomass inferred by density and body length of zooplankton. Overall, the utility of metabarcoding for taxonomic profiling of zooplankton communities was validated by the morphology-based method on a large ecological scale.

Paleogenetics provides a powerful framework to reconstruct the long-term temporal dynamics of various biological groups from aquatic sediments. However, validations are still required to ensure the authenticity of the molecular signal obtained from sedimentary DNA. Here, we investigated the effects of early diagenesis on the DNA signal from micro-eukaryotes preserved in sediments by comparing metabarcoding inventories obtained for two sediment cores sampled in 2007 and 2013 respectively. High-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of sedimentary DNA was utilized to reconstruct the composition of microbial eukaryotic communities by targeting the V7 region of the 18S rDNA gene. No significant difference was detected between the molecular inventories obtained for the two cores both for total richness and diversity indices. Moreover, community structures obtained for the two cores were congruent as revealed by procrustean analysis. Though most of the eukaryotic groups showed no significant difference in terms of richness and relative proportion according to the core, the group of fungi was found to differ both in terms of richness and relative proportion (possibly due to their spatial heterogeneity and potential activity in sediments). Considering the OTUs level (i.e. Operational Taxonomic Units as a proxy of ecological species), our results showed that, for the older analyzed strata (age: 15–40 years), the composition and structure of communities were very similar for the two cores (except for fungi) and the DNA signal was considered stable. However, for the uppermost strata (age < 15 years), changes of moderate magnitude were detected in the relative abundance of few OTUs. Overall, this study points out that, in Nylandssjön sediments, early diagenesis did not induce marked modifications in the micro-eukaryotic DNA signal, thus opening new perspectives based on the analysis of eukaryotic sedimentary DNA to address scientific issues both in the domains of paleolimnology and microbial ecology. Because this study site is ideal for DNA preservation in sediment (quick sedimentation processes, no sediment resuspension, anoxic conditions at sediment–water interface), the generalization of our conclusions, in particular for less favorable sites, must be considered cautiously.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","eDNA | Metabarcoding | Paleogenetics | Plankton | Sediment","13937","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","655","58","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

We identified at least 21 shark species, from both Caribbean and Pacific Coral Sea water samples, whose geographical patterns of diversity and read abundance coincide with geographical differences in levels of anthropogenic pressure and conservation effort.

Correlative data from a coniferous forest ecosystem support the hypothesis that interactions between fungal guilds play a central role in regulating organic matter accumulation in relation to fertility. With increasing ecosystem fertility, the proportion of saprotrophic basidiomycetes increased in deeper organic layers, at the expense of ectomycorrhizal fungal species. Saprotrophs correlated positively with the activity of oxidative enzymes, which in turn favoured organic matter turnover and nitrogen recycling to plants.

Faced with the decline of pollinators, it is relevant to strengthen our understanding of the whole plant-pollinator web in semi-natural grasslands that serve as refuges for pollinator populations. The aim of this study was to explore the diversity of flower-foraging insects involved in pollen transfer in mountain semi-natural grasslands. Insects actively collecting pollen and/or nectar were caught in spring in six mountain semi-natural grasslands displaying a floristic richness gradient. Individual determinations of insects were made at the finest possible taxonomic scale and pollen loads were removed from the insect body. Using next-generation DNA sequencing, pollens were identified through the ribosomal DNA cistron using the ITS2 database and the ITS plant rDNA cistron sequences from Genbank. A total of 236 flower-foraging insects were collected. Diptera represented 82% of the total catches distantly followed by Hymenoptera (15%) and Apoidea (bees) (11%). Visual observations revealed that Diptera foraged on 16 of the 21 flower species visited by insects. DNA metabarcoding showed that 82% (191) of all of the collected insects were carrying pollen and 44% (104) were carrying two genera of plants or more. Our results demonstrate that Diptera are potential key-pollinators in mountain semi-natural grasslands that cannot be overlooked by the scientific community. However difficulties of taxonomic determination due to severe shortage of experts for Diptera have to be urgently overcome. Further studies on the link between pollen transfer and actual pollination in a global change context are also required. Moreover, our results support the idea that DNA metabarcoding provides accurate information about the plants-insects networks but it also pointed out sensitive issues, especially the necessity to build reliable national barcode databases.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","DNA barcoding | Flower-foraging insects | Plant-pollinator interactions | Pollen loads | Semi-natural grasslands","20486","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","664","21","5-6",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Grey wolves (Canis lupus) host and spread endoparasites that can either directly infect canid conspecifics or their prey serving as intermediate hosts of indirectly transmitted species. The wolf recolonization of Central Europe represents an opportunity to study parasite transmission dynamics between wildlife and domestic species for cases when a definitive host returns after local extinction – a situation equivalent to a ‘removal experiment’. Here we investigate whether the re–appearance of wolves has increased parasite pressure on hunting dogs – a group of companion animals of particular interest as they have a similar diet to wolves and flush wolf habitats when hunting. We compared prevalence (P) and species richness (SR) of helminths and the protozoan Sarcocystis to determine whether they were higher in hunting dogs from wolf areas (ndogs = 49) than a control area (ndogs = 29) without wolves. Of particular interest were S. grueneri and S. taeniata, known as ‘wolf specialists’. Five helminth and 11 Sarcocystis species were identified, of which all helminths and eight Sarcocystis species were shared between dogs and wolves. Overall prevalence and species richness of helminths (P:38.5% vs. 24.1%; SRmean:0.4 vs. 0.3 species) and Sarcocystis (P:63.3% vs. 65.5%, SRmean:2.1 vs. 1.8 species) did not differ between study sites. However, hunting dogs were significantly more likely to be infected with S. grueneri in wolf areas (P:45.2% vs. 10.5%; p = 0.035). The findings suggest that wolves indirectly increase S. grueneri infection risk for hunting dogs since cervids are intermediate hosts and occasionally fed to dogs. Furthermore, a periodic anthelminthic treatment of hunting dogs may be an effective measure to control helminth infections regardless of wolf presence.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Canis lupus | Epidemiology | Helminths | Hunting dogs | Metabarcoding | NGS | Protozoa | Sarcocystis","21100228130","Az 35-2130/7+5-58/13","Leibniz-Gemeinschaft","1","TRUE","665","6","3",NA,NA,NA,"S2213224417300718",2017

We classified 34 tumours into CRC subtypes using RNA-sequencing derived gene expression and determined relative abundances of bacterial taxonomic groups using 16S rRNA amplicon metabarcoding. 16S rRNA analysis showed enrichment of Fusobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and decreased levels of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in CMS1. A more detailed analysis of bacterial taxa using non-human RNA-sequencing reads uncovered distinct bacterial communities associated with each molecular subtype. The most highly enriched species associated with CMS1 included Fusobacterium hwasookii and Porphyromonas gingivalis. CMS2 was enriched for Selenomas and Prevotella species, while CMS3 had few significant associations.

A limitation of this approach is the inherent lack of unique species-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms available for unequivocal species identification. We designed a novel primer pair capable of amplifying whole mitochondrial genomes and evaluated it in silico for a wide range of ray-finned fishes (Class: Actinopterygii). We tested the primer pair using long-range PCR and Illumina sequencing in vitro on a mock community of fish species assembled from pooling genomic DNA extracted from tissues. In situ we utilized long-range PCR and Illumina sequencing to generate fragments between 16 and 17 kb from eDNA extracted from filtered water samples. Water samples were sourced from a mesocosm experiment and from a natural stream. We validated our method in silico for 61 orders of Actinopterygii; we successfully sequenced mitogenomes in vitro from all six species in our mock community. In situ we recovered mitogenomes for all species present in our mesocosms. We additionally recovered mitogenomes from 10 of 12 species caught at the time of water sampling and two species previously only detected from eDNA metabarcoding of short DNA fragments from a natural stream. Successful amplification of large fragments (>16 kb) from eDNA demonstrates that not all eDNA is highly degraded.

A total of 29 phyla (29 in NS, 21 in TTA) and 305 genera (289 in NS, 182 in TTA) were identified. Mycoplasma (60.8%) was the most abundant genus identified in both the NS (27.3%) and TTA (76.7%) samples, followed by Moraxella (16.6%) in the NS and Pasteurella (7.3%) in the TTA samples.

Here, we present the first application of this approach to explore GIN species diversity and the impact of anthelmintic drug treatments. First, we investigated GIN species diversity in cow-calf beef cattle herds in several different regions, using coproculture derived L3s. A screen of 50 Canadian beef herds revealed parasite species diversity to be low overall. The majority of parasite communities were comprised of just two species; Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora. Cooperia punctata was present at much lower levels overall, but nevertheless comprised a substantive part of the parasite community of several herds in eastern Canada. In contrast, nemabiome sequencing revealed higher GIN species diversity in beef calves sampled from central/south-eastern USA and Sao Paulo State, Brazil. In these regions C. punctata predominated in most herds with Haemonchus placei predominating in a few cases. Ostertagia ostertagi and C. oncophora were relatively minor species in these regions in contrast to the Canadian herds. We also examined the impact of routine macrocyclic lactone pour-on treatments on GIN communities in the Canadian beef herds. Low treatment effectiveness was observed in many cases, and nemabiome sequencing revealed an overall increase in the proportion of Cooperia spp. relative to O. ostertagi post-treatment.

In Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) gives the legal basis for the use of this indicator for water quality assessment and its management. Several quality indices, like the Specific Polluosensitivity Index (SPI), were developed to assess the ecological quality status of rivers based on diatom communities. It is based on morphological identifications and count of diatom species present in natural biofilms using a microscope. This methodology requires high taxonomic skills and several hours of analysis per sample as 400 individuals must be identified to species level. Since several years, a molecular approach based on DNA metabarcoding combined to High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is developed to characterize species assemblages in environmental samples which is potentially faster and cheaper. The ability of this approach to provide reliable diatom inventories has been demonstrated and its application to water quality assessment is currently being improved. Despite optimization of the DNA metabarcoding process with diatoms, few studies had yet extended it at the scale of a freshwater monitoring network and evaluated the reliability of its quality assessment compared to the classical morphological approach. In the present study we applied DNA metabarcoding to the river monitoring network of the tropical Island Mayotte. This island is a French département since 2011 and the WFD has to be applied. This offered the opportunity to scale up the comparison of molecular and morphological approaches and their ability to produce comparable community inventories and water quality assessments. Benthic diatoms were sampled following WFD standards in 45 river sites in 2014 and 2015 (80 samples). All samples were submitted in parallel to the molecular and the morphological approaches. DNA metabarcoding was carried out using Genelute DNA extraction method, rbcL DNA barcode and PGM sequencing, while microscopic counts were carried out for the classical methodology. Diatom community structures in terms of molecular (OTUs) and of morphological (species) were significantly correlated. However, only 13% of the species was shared by both approaches, with qualitative and quantitative variation due to i) the incompleteness of the reference library (82% of morphological species are not represented in the database), ii) limits in taxonomic knowledge and iii) biases in the estimation of relative abundances linked to diatom cell biovolume. However, ecological quality status assessed with the molecular and morphological SPI values were congruent, and little affected by sequencing depth. DNA metabarcoding of diatom communities allowed a reliable estimation of the quality status for most of the rivers at the scale of the full biomonitoring network of Mayotte Island.","20","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Biomonitoring | Diatoms | DNA metabarcoding | Freshwater monitoring network | Water framework directive","20292","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","674","82",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S1470160X17303497",2017

High-throughput sequencing metabarcoding studies in marine biosecurity have largely focused on targeting environmental DNA (eDNA). DNA can persist extracellularly in the environment, making discrimination of living organisms difficult. In this study, bilge water samples (i.e., water accumulating on-board a vessel during transit) were collected from 15 small recreational and commercial vessels. eDNA and eRNA molecules were co-extracted and the V4 region of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene targeted for metabarcoding. In total, 62.7% of the Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were identified at least once in the corresponding eDNA and eRNA reads, with 19.5% unique to eDNA and 17.7% to eRNA. There were substantial differences in diversity between molecular compartments; 57% of sequences from eDNA-only OTUs belonged to fungi, likely originating from legacy DNA. In contrast, there was a higher percentage of metazoan (50.2%) and ciliate (31.7%) sequences in the eRNA-only OTUs. Our data suggest that the presence of eRNA-only OTUs could be due to increased cellular activities of some rare taxa that were not identified in the eDNA datasets, unusually high numbers of rRNA transcripts in ciliates, and/or artefacts produced during the reverse transcriptase, PCR and sequencing steps. The proportions of eDNA/eRNA shared and unshared OTUs were highly heterogeneous within individual bilge water samples. Multiple factors including boat type and the activities performed on-board, such as washing of scientific equipment, may play a major role in contributing to this variability. For some marine biosecurity applications analysis, eDNA-only data may be sufficient, however there are an increasing number of instances where distinguishing the living portion of a community is essential. For these circumstances, we suggest only including OTUs that are present in both eDNA and eRNA data. OTUs found only in the eRNA data need to be interpreted with caution until further research provides conclusive evidence for their origin.","20","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"10600153309","SCI 2016/17","National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research","1","TRUE","675","12","11","29095959","e0187636","NIWA",NA,2017

Characterization of microbial communities in stressful conditions at a field level is rather scarce, especially when considering fungal communities from aboveground habitats. We aimed at characterizing fungal communities from different poplar habitats at a Hg-contaminated phytomanagement site by using Illumina-based sequencing, network analysis approach, and direct isolation of Hg-resistant fungal strains. The highest diversity estimated by the Shannon index was found for soil communities, which was negatively affected by soil Hg concentration. Among the significant correlations between soil operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the co-occurrence network, 80% were negatively correlated revealing dominance of a pattern of mutual exclusion. The fungal communities associated with Populus roots mostly consisted of OTUs from the symbiotic guild, such as members of the Thelephoraceae, thus explaining the lowest diversity found for root communities. Additionally, root communities showed the highest network connectivity index, while rarely detected OTUs from the Glomeromycetes may have a central role in the root network. Unexpectedly high richness and diversity were found for aboveground habitats, compared to the root habitat. The aboveground habitats were dominated by yeasts from the Lalaria, Davidiella, and Bensingtonia genera, not detected in belowground habitats. Leaf and stem habitats were characterized by few dominant OTUs such as those from the Dothideomycete class producing mutual exclusion with other OTUs. Aureobasidium pullulans, one of the dominating OTUs, was further isolated from the leaf habitat, in addition to Nakazawaea populi species, which were found to be Hg resistant. Altogether, these findings will provide an improved point of reference for microbial research on inoculation-based programs of tailings dumps.","10","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Hg resistance | Hg-enriched tailings dump | Illumina MiSeq | Internal transcribed spacer metabarcoding | Network | Poplar microbiome","20266","PROLIPHYT 1172C0053","Agence Nationale de la Recherche","0","FALSE","678","74","4","28451743",NA,"ADEME",NA,2017

Although metazoan animals in the mesopelagic zone play critical roles in deep pelagic food webs and in the attenuation of carbon in midwaters, the diversity of these assemblages is not fully known. A metabarcoding survey of mesozooplankton diversity across the epipelagic, mesopelagic and upper bathypelagic zones (0–1500 m) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre revealed far higher estimates of species richness than expected given prior morphology-based studies in the region (4,024 OTUs, 10-fold increase), despite conservative bioinformatic processing. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness of the full assemblage peaked at lower epipelagic–upper mesopelagic depths (100–300 m), with slight shoaling of maximal richness at night due to diel vertical migration, in contrast to expectations of a deep mesopelagic diversity maximum as reported for several plankton groups in early systematic and zoogeographic studies. Four distinct depth-stratified species assemblages were identified, with faunal transitions occurring at 100 m, 300 m and 500 m. Highest diversity occurred in the smallest zooplankton size fractions (0.2–0.5 mm), which had significantly lower % OTUs classified due to poor representation in reference databases, suggesting a deep reservoir of poorly understood diversity in the smallest metazoan animals. A diverse meroplankton assemblage also was detected (350 OTUs), including larvae of both shallow and deep living benthic species. Our results provide some of the first insights into the hidden diversity present in zooplankton assemblages in midwaters, and a molecular reappraisal of vertical gradients in species richness, depth distributions and community composition for the full zooplankton assemblage across the epipelagic, mesopelagic and upper bathypelagic zones.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","18S rRNA | marine zooplankton | mesopelagic | metabarcoding | station ALOHA","20297","OCE-1255697","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas","1","TRUE","679","26","21","28792641",NA,NA,NA,2017

Amphibian conservation in Neotropical biomes is critical because freshwater ecosystems typically experience sharp declines in biodiversity before much is known about species that depend on those environments. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a new approach for monitoring aquatic organisms and provides valuable information on species occurrence in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we assess community diversity in Neotropical streams using eDNA metabarcoding. We compare data from a five-year traditional field survey with results from a short-term eDNA analysis in four streams of the Atlantic forest of southeastern Brazil. We recorded 19 species over 5 years using visual-acoustic methods, of which 10 species are associated with the streams during at least one life stage (egg, tadpole or post-metamorphic). We were able to detect nine of the latter species using eDNA metabarcoding from water samples collected over 4 days. Amphibian community composition as measured by both methods showed high similarity in three streams, but was not perfect, as eDNA failed to detect known species in a fourth stream. Furthermore, in one stream we detected through eDNA metabarcoding a species (Aplastodiscus eugenioi) found only once during the 5-year traditional survey in that stream. Also, three species (Cycloramphus boraceiensis, Hylodes asper, and Hylodes phyllodes) with the highest dependence on aquatic habitat showed the highest number of positive PCR detections on eDNA samples. Our results showed that eDNA metabarcoding can be a useful tool to assess community diversity in tropical streams, and although not perfect in detection, this method can potentially improve our ability to conserve Neotropical amphibians.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","12S rRNA mitochondrial gene | Biodiversity assessment | Community sampling | eDNA metabarcoding | High throughput sequencing","17244","401729/2013-3","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico","0","FALSE","680","215",NA,NA,NA,"CNPq","S0006320717303026",2017

This report describes the biodiversity and ecology of microbial mats developed in thermal gradients (20 to 65°C) in the surroundings of three drillings (Chiraleu [CH], Ciocaia [CI], and Mihai Bravu [MB]) tapping a hyperthermal aquifer in Romania. Using a metabarcoding approach, 16S rRNA genes were sequenced from both DNA and RNA transcripts (cDNA) and compared. The relationships between the microbial diversity and the physicochemical factors were explored. Additionally, the cDNA data were used for in silico functionality predictions, bringing new insights into the functional potential and dynamics of these communities. The results showed that each hot spring determined the formation of distinct microbial communities. In the CH mats (40 to 53°C), the abundance of Cyanobacteria decreased with temperature, opposite to those of Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria. Ectothiorhodospira, Oscillatoria, and methanogenic archaea dominated the CI communities (20 to 65°C), while the MB microbial mats (53 to 65°C) were mainly composed of Chloroflexi, Hydrogenophilus, Thermi, and Aquificae. Alpha-diversity was negatively correlated with the increase in water temperature, while beta-diversity was shaped in each hot spring by the unique combination of physicochemical parameters, regardless of the type of nucleic acid analyzed (DNA versus cDNA). The rank correlation analysis revealed a unique model that associated environmental data with community composition, consisting in the combined effect of Na+, K+, HCO3-, and PO43- concentrations, together with temperature and electrical conductivity. These factors seem to determine the grouping of samples according to location, rather than with the similarities in thermal regimes, showing that other parameters beside temperature are significant drivers of biodiversity.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Hot spring | Metabarcoding | Microbial diversity | Microbial ecology","19618","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","681","83","21","28821552",NA,NA,NA,2017

This study compares sedDNA metabarcoding and pollen records from surface sediments of 31 lakes along a north–south gradient of increasing forest cover in northern Siberia (Taymyr peninsula) with data from field surveys in the surroundings of the lakes. sedDNA metabarcoding recorded 114 plant taxa, about half of them to species level, while pollen analyses identified 43 taxa, both exceeding the 31 taxa found by vegetation field surveys. Increasing Larix percentages from north to south were consistently recorded by all three methods and principal component analyses based on percentage data of vegetation surveys and DNA sequences separated tundra from forested sites. Comparisons of the ordinations using procrustes and protest analyses show a significant fit among all compared pairs of records. Despite similarities of sedDNA and pollen records, certain idiosyncrasies, such as high percentages of Alnus and Betula in all pollen and high percentages of Salix in all sedDNA spectra, are observable.

The versatility of MiMammal primers was tested in silico and by amplifying DNAs extracted from tissues. The results suggested that MiMammal primers are capable of amplifying and distinguishing a diverse group of mammalian species.

Recently, several attempts have been made to use eDNA metabarcoding as an alternative tool. However, until now, most applied metabarcoding studies have been based on the taxonomic assignment of sequences that provides reference to morphospecies ecology. Usually, only a small portion of metabarcoding data can be used due to a limited reference database and a lack of phylogenetic resolution. Here, we investigate the possibility to overcome these limitations using a taxonomy-free approach that allows the computing of a molecular index directly from eDNA data without any reference to morphotaxonomy. As a case study, we use the benthic diatoms index, commonly used for monitoring the biological quality of rivers and streams. We analysed 87 epilithic samples from Swiss rivers, the ecological status of which was established based on the microscopic identification of diatom species. We compared the diatom index derived from eDNA data obtained with or without taxonomic assignment. Our taxonomy-free approach yields promising results by providing a correct assessment for 77% of examined sites. The main advantage of this method is that almost 95% of OTUs could be used for index calculation, compared to 35% in the case of the taxonomic assignment approach. Its main limitations are under-sampling and the need to calibrate the index based on the microscopic assessment of diatoms communities. However, once calibrated, the taxonomy-free molecular index can be easily standardized and applied in routine biomonitoring, as a complementary tool allowing fast and cost-effective assessment of the biological quality of watercourses.","30","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","bioindication | environmental DNA | metabarcoding | water quality","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","684","17","6","28296259",NA,NA,NA,2017

Understanding the responses of biodiversity to different land use regimes is critical for managing biodiversity in the face of future land use change. However, there is still significant uncertainty around how consistent the responses of different taxonomic groups to land use change are. Here, we use a combination of high-throughput environmental DNA sequencing and traditional field-based survey methods to examine how patterns of richness and community composition correlate among four domains/kingdoms (bacteria, fungi, plants, and metazoans) and the four most-abundant animal taxonomic groups (arachnids, Collembola, insects, and nematodes) across five different land use types (natural forest, planted forest, unimproved grassland, improved grassland, and vineyards). Richness for each taxonomic group varied between land use types, yet different taxa showed inconsistent responses to land use, and their richness was rarely correlated. This contrasted with community composition of taxonomic groups, for which there was relatively good discrimination of land use types and there was strong correlation between group responses. We found little evidence for consistent drivers of taxonomic richness, yet identified several significant drivers of community composition that were shared across many groups. Drivers of composition were not the same as the drivers of diversity, suggesting diversity and composition are independently controlled. While land use intensification has been viewed as having generally negative effects on biodiversity, our results provide evidence that different taxa respond divergently across different land uses. Further, our study demonstrates the power of high-throughput sequencing of environmental DNA as a tool for addressing broad ecological patterns relating to landscape biodiversity.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Animals | Bacteria | Biodiversity | Community structure | DNA metabarcoding | Fungi | Intensification | Land use | Plants | Soil.","21100307458","PROP-29430-ESI-LCR","Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment","1","TRUE","685","8","11",NA,"e01997",NA,NA,2017

However, it is unclear whether restoration of biodiverse habitat can reverse this effect, and what role the environmental microbiome might have in such recovery.

The Directive further seeks to promote broadly standardized monitoring efforts and assessment of temporal trends in marine ecosystem condition, incorporating metrics describing the distribution and impacts of NIS. Accomplishing these goals will require application of advanced tools for NIS surveillance and risk assessment, particularly given known challenges associated with surveying and monitoring with traditional methods. In the past decade, a host of methods based on nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) analysis have been developed or advanced that promise to dramatically enhance capacity in assessing and managing NIS. However, ensuring that these rapidly evolving approaches remain accessible and responsive to the needs of resource managers remains a challenge. This paper provides recommendations for future development of these genetic tools for assessment and management of NIS in marine systems, within the context of the explicit requirements of the MSFD. Issues considered include technological innovation, methodological standardization, data sharing and collaboration, and the critical importance of shared foundational resources, particularly integrated taxonomic expertise. Though the recommendations offered here are not exhaustive, they provide a basis for future intentional (and international) collaborative development of a genetic toolkit for NIS research, capable of fulfilling the immediate and long term goals of marine ecosystem and resource conservation.","11","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Early detection | Environmental DNA | Good environmental status | High throughput sequencing | Marine invasive species | Marine Strategy Framework Directive | Metabarcoding | Monitoring | Surveillance","27851","undefined","Seventh Framework Programme","1","TRUE","687","85",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0308597X17303421",2017

To improve the accuracy of OTU predictions and overcome both computations, storage and noise issues, recent studies and tools suggested removing all single reads and low abundant OTUs, considering them as noise. Although the effect of applying an OTU abundance threshold on a- and ß-diversity has been well documented, the consequences of removing single reads have been poorly studied.

Scalability to large data sets is also assessed using a complete MiSeq run. We show that SRF drastically reduces the chimera content and computational time, enabling the analysis of a complete MiSeq run in just a few minutes. Moreover, SRF accurately determines the actual community diversity: the differences in a- and ß-community diversity obtained with SRF and standard procedures are much smaller than the intrinsic variability of technical and biological replicates.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","16SrRNA | Illumina | metabarcoding | microbial diversity | singleton filtering","11700154306","31000553","Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique","0","FALSE","688","17","6","28695665",NA,NA,NA,2017

Flax dew-retting is a key step in the industrial extraction of fibers from flax stems and is dependent upon the production of a battery of hydrolytic enzymes produced by micro-organisms during this process. To explore the diversity and dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities involved in this process we applied a high-throughput sequencing (HTS) DNA metabarcoding approach (16S rRNA/ITS region, Illumina Miseq) on plant and soil samples obtained over a period of 7 weeks in July and August 2014. Twenty-three bacterial and six fungal phyla were identified in soil samples and 11 bacterial and four fungal phyla in plant samples. Dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes (bacteria) and Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota (fungi) all of which have been previously associated with flax dew-retting except for Bacteroidetes and Basidiomycota that were identified for the first time. Rare phyla also identified for the first time in this process included Acidobacteria, CKC4, Chlorobi, Fibrobacteres, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae and TM6 (bacteria), and Chytridiomycota (fungi). No differences in microbial communities and colonization dynamics were observed between early and standard flax harvests. In contrast, the common agricultural practice of swath turning affects both bacterial and fungal community membership and structure in straw samples and may contribute to a more uniform retting. Prediction of community function using PICRUSt indicated the presence of a large collection of potential bacterial enzymes capable of hydrolyzing backbones and side-chains of cell wall polysaccharides. Assignment of functional guild (functional group) using FUNGuild software highlighted a change from parasitic to saprophytic trophic modes in fungi during retting. This work provides the first exhaustive description of the microbial communities involved in flax dew-retting and will provide a valuable benchmark in future studies aiming to evaluate the effects of other parameters (e.g., year-to year and site variability etc.) on this complex process.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","16S rRNA and ITS amplicons | Bacterial and fungal microbiota dynamics | CAZyme predictions | Flax dew-retting | High-throughput sequencing | HTS | Metabarcoding | Trophic modes","21100226442","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","691","8","OCT",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Only a few studies cover vegetation changes since the last interglacial, as most of the former landscapes are inundated and difficult to access. Using pollen analysis and sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) metabarcoding, we reveal vegetation changes on Bol’shoy Lyakhovsky Island since the last interglacial from permafrost sediments. Last interglacial samples depict high levels of floral diversity with the presence of trees (Larix, Picea, Populus) and shrubs (Alnus, Betula, Ribes, Cornus, Saliceae) on the currently treeless island. After the Last Glacial Maximum, Larix re-colonised the island but disappeared along with most shrub taxa. This was probably caused by Holocene sealevel rise, which led to increased oceanic conditions on the island. Additionally, we applied two newly developed larch-specific chloroplast markers to evaluate their potential for tracking past population dynamics from environmental samples. The novel markers were successfully resequenced and exhibited two variants of each marker in last interglacial samples. SedaDNA can track vegetation changes as well as genetic changes across geographic space through time and can improve our understanding of past processes that shape modern patterns.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Larix | Metabarcoding | Mis 5 to 1 | Palaeoenvironment | Permafrost deposits | Radiocarbon ages | Sedadna | Single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) | Treeline | Trnl","19700188368","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","692","8","10",NA,"273",NA,NA,2017

Metabarcoding of marine environmental DNA (eDNA), originating from tissue, cells, or extracellular DNA, offers the opportunity to survey the biological composition of communities across multiple trophic levels from a non-invasive seawater sample. Here we compare results of eDNA metabarcoding of multiple trophic levels from individual seawater samples collected from a kelp forest in Monterey Bay, California in order to establish methods for future cross-trophic level eDNA analysis. Triplicate 1 L water samples were filtered using five different 47 mm diameter membrane filters (PVDF, PES, GFF, PCTE, and NC) and DNA was extracted from triplicates of each filter-type using three widely-used extraction methods (the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit, the MoBio PowerWater DNA Isolation kit, and standard phenol/chloroform methods) resulting in 45 individual eDNA samples prepared with 15 workflow combinations. Each DNA extract was amplified using PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene (microorganisms; Bacteria and Archaea), 18S rRNA gene (phytoplankton), and the 12S rRNA gene (vertebrates), and PCR products were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. The richness and community composition of microbial, phytoplankton, and vertebrate OTUs were not significantly different between any of the 0.2 µm pore-size filter types extracted with the DNeasy or MoBio kits. However, phenol/chloroform extraction resulted in significantly different community structures. This study provides insight into multiple choices for extraction and filtration methods to use eDNA metabarcoding for biodiversity assessment of multiple trophic levels from a single sample. We recommend any combination of either DNeasy or MoBio with PES, PCTE, PVDF, or NC filters for a cross trophic level comparison.","11","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","Biodiversity | Environmental DNA | Marine ecosystems | Microorganisms | Phytoplankton | Trophic levels | Vertebrates","21100790929","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","693","4","OCT",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Harmful dinoflagellate cysts (e.g. dinocysts) represent a great threat to marine and coastal ecosystems and even human health. As dinocysts have resistant cell walls that allow dinoflagellate species to successfully survive harsh environments, they can easily pass through multiple barriers during biological invasions and successfully colonize new locations. In introduced ranges, dinocysts often serve as seeds for harmful algal blooms, which can result in large-scale environmental disasters and economic losses. Correct identification of dinocysts represents the first step for both ecological studies and management programs. However, traditional methods, which are based on morphological observations, pose great technical challenges for dinocysts. Recent advances in molecular techniques, such as high-throughput sequencing-based metabarcoding, have tremendously revolutionized our abilities to detect marine biodiversity. Here, we summarize species composition of non-indigenous/cryptogenic dinocysts and their identification methods commonly used in China, discuss major problems in traditional morphological identification and technical issues of molecular identification, and finally propose future perspectives for the efficient identification of non-indigenous dinocysts using high-throughput sequencing-based metabarcoding. We also discuss technical issues that should be addressed before high-throughput sequencing-based metabarcoding can be widely used for dinocyst identification at large geographical scales.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","biological invasion | metabarcoding | molecular identification | morphological identification","16730","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","695","20","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L., hereafter stickleback') is a common mesopredatory fish in marine, coastal and freshwater areas. In large parts of the Baltic Sea, stickleback densities have increased >10-fold during the last decades, and it is now one of the dominating fish species both in terms of biomass and effects on lower trophic levels. Still, relatively little is known about its diet-knowledge which is essential to understand the increasing role sticklebacks play in the ecosystem. Fish diet analyses typically rely on visual identification of stomach contents, a labour-intensive method that is made difficult by prey digestion and requires expert taxonomic knowledge. However, advances in DNAbased metabarcoding methods promise a simultaneous identification of most prey items, even from semi-digested tissue. Here, we studied the diet of stickleback from the western Baltic Sea coast using both DNA metabarcoding and visual analysis of stomach contents. Using the cytochrome oxidase (CO1) marker we identified 120 prey taxa in the diet, belonging to 15 phyla, 83 genera and 84 species. Compared to previous studies, this is an unusually high prey diversity. Chironomids, cladocerans and harpacticoids were dominating prey items. Large sticklebacks were found to feed more on benthic prey, such as amphipods, gastropods and isopods. DNA metabarcoding gave much higher taxonomic resolution (median rank genus) than visual analysis (median rank order), and many taxa identified using barcoding could not have been identified visually. However, a few taxa identified by visual inspection were not revealed by barcoding. In summary, our results suggest that the three-spined stickleback feeds on a wide variety of both pelagic and benthic organisms, indicating that the strong increase in stickleback populations may affect many parts of the Baltic Sea coastal ecosystem.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","697","12","10","29059215","e0186929",NA,NA,2017

Methods in Ecology and Evolution © 2017 British Ecological Society DNA metabarcoding holds great promise for the assessment of macroinvertebrates in stream ecosystems. However, few large-scale studies have compared the performance of DNA metabarcoding with that of routine morphological identification. We performed metabarcoding using four primer sets on macroinvertebrate samples from 18 stream sites across Finland. The samples were collected in 2013 and identified based on morphology as part of a Finnish stream monitoring program. Specimens were morphologically classified, following standardised protocols, to the lowest taxonomic level for which identification was feasible in the routine national monitoring. DNA metabarcoding identified more than twice the number of taxa than the morphology-based protocol, and also yielded a higher taxonomic resolution. For each sample, we detected more taxa by metabarcoding than by the morphological method, and all four primer sets exhibited comparably good performance. Sequence read abundance and the number of specimens per taxon (a proxy for biomass) were significantly correlated in each sample, although the adjusted R2 values were low. With a few exceptions, the ecological status assessment metrics calculated from morphological and DNA metabarcoding datasets were similar. Given the recent reduction in sequencing costs, metabarcoding is currently approximately as expensive as morphology-based identification. Using samples obtained in the field, we demonstrated that DNA metabarcoding can achieve comparable assessment results to current protocols relying on morphological identification. Thus, metabarcoding represents a feasible and reliable method to identify macroinvertebrates in stream bioassessment, and offers powerful advantage over morphological identification in providing identification for taxonomic groups that are unfeasible to identify in routine protocols. To unlock the full potential of DNA metabarcoding for ecosystem assessment, however, it will be necessary to address key problems with current laboratory protocols and reference databases.","39","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","biomass bias | ecological status | high-throughput sequencing | macroinvertebrates | metabarcoding","21100217611","CA15219","Academy of Finland","0","FALSE","698","8","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Odonates are potentially important top-down regulators of many insects. Yet, to date, our knowledge of odonate prey use is based mainly on limited observations of odonates catching or eating their prey. In this study, we examine the potential use of metabarcoding in establishing the diet of three adult odonate species (Lestes sponsa, Enallagma cyathigerum, and Sympetrum danae) at a site in southwestern Finland. To this purpose, we compared three different methods for extracting DNA from fecal samples: the Macherey-Nagel Nucleospin XS kit, a traditional salt extraction, and the Zymo Research Fecal Microprep kit. From these extracts, we amplified group-specific mitochondrial markers (COI and 16S rRNA) from altogether 72 odonate individuals, and compared them to comprehensive reference libraries. The three odonate species show major overlap in diet, with no significant differences between individuals of different size and/or gender, reflecting opportunistic foraging of adult odonates. Of a total of 41 different prey species detected, the most frequently consumed ones were Diptera, with additional records of six other orders. Based on our data, the best DNA extraction method is the traditional salt extraction, as it provides the most information on prey content while also being the most economical. To our knowledge, this is the first study to resolve the species-level diet of adult odonates. Armed with the appropriate methodological caveats, we are ready to examine the ecological role of odonates in both terrestrial and aquatic food webs, and in transferring subsidies between these two realms.","12","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","16S | cytochrome oxidase subunit I | damselfly | diet | dragonfly | fecal DNA | food web | Illumina MiSeq | Odonata","21100264002","undefined","Academy of Finland","1","TRUE","699","7","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

When comparing plant diversities and taxonomic composition among buildings or between seasons, no obvious pattern was detected, except for the second summer, when pollen coming from outdoors was highly dominant and the proportions of likely allergens, birch, grass, alder and mugwort pollen, were very high. The average pairwise values of SørensenChao indices that were used to compare similarities for taxon composition between samples among the samples from the two university buildings, two nurseries and farmhouse equaled 0.514, 0.109, 0.564, 0.865 and 0.867, respectively, while the mean similarity index for all samples was 0.524. Cleaning frequency may strongly contribute to the observed diversity. The discovery of considerable diversities, including pollen coming from outside, in both winter and summer shows that substantial amounts of pollen produced in summer enter buildings and stay there throughout the year.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","2",NA,"19937","1055",NA,"0","FALSE","700","35","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

The temporal dynamics of most tundra food webs are shaped by the cyclic population dynamics of lemmings.

We present here the first DNA metabarcoding data on the winter diet of Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus), based on feces collected after a winter of population increase. Prostrate willows, mosses, and graminoids dominated the species winter diet, indicating that the conventional idea of lemmings as moss-specialists should be revised. The behavior of lemming-plant models in theoretical studies is conditional on the assumptions of mosses being their main winter food item. As shrubs have been excluded from the framework of these models, incorporating them in future modeling studies should nuance our understanding on how plants affect lemmings. We also sampled diet of a few individuals found dead on top of the snow. These individuals had relatively empty stomachs and had, prior to death, relied heavily on mosses. This apparent lack of abundant good quality indicates spatial heterogeneity in local food availability during the population increase phase.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Arctic | Bryophyte | Lemmus lemmus | Prostrate Salix | Snowbed | Winter","13048","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","702","40","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Methods in Ecology and Evolution © 2017 British Ecological Society DNA barcoding and metabarcoding are increasingly used as alternatives to traditional morphological identifications. For animals, the standard barcode is a c. 658-bp portion of the COI gene, for which reference libraries now cover a large proportion of described mammal species. Unfortunately, because its sequence is too long and does not contain highly conserved primer binding sites, this marker is not adapted for metabarcoding. Although alternative metabarcodes have been developed, their performances are generally seldom assessed. We evaluate the reliability of a short metabarcode located in the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA for the identifications of Amazonian mammals. We (i) constitute a nearly exhaustive reference library for species found in French Guiana, (ii) assess the taxonomic resolution of the marker and validate its use with dipteran blood meal analyses, (iii) assess the conservation of the primer binding sites, and (iv) compare its theoretical performances with that of a newly designed metabarcode located within the standard COI barcode. About 576 specimens representing 164 species were gathered and sequenced. We show that the 12S marker allows remarkably accurate taxonomic assignations despite its very short size, and that primer binding sites are highly conserved, which is important to avoid PCR amplification bias potentially leading to detection failure. Additionally, our results stress that the identifications should only be considered at the generic level when they are based on incomplete reference libraries, even when a stringent similarity cut-off is used. A new short COI metabarcode was designed based on 569 reference sequences of mammals retrieved on BOLD. Our results clearly show that, while both markers provide similar taxonomic resolution, much higher rates of primer mismatches are found with COI. Besides demonstrating the accuracy of the short 12S marker for the identification of Amazonian mammals and providing a reliable molecular reference database, this study emphasizes that the accuracy of taxonomic assignations highly depends on the comprehensiveness of the reference library and that great caution should be taken for interpreting metabarcoding results based on scarce reference libraries. The comparison with a short COI metabarcode also provides novel evidence in support for the use of ribosomal markers in metabarcoding studies.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","blood meals | COI | French Guiana | mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene | sand fly","21100217611","ANR-10-LABX-25-01","Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier","0","FALSE","703","8","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Due to methodological challenges there are only a few studies that focus on macrophyte dynamics in large lakes despite their notable role in a lake’s ecosystem functioning. This study investigates composition and productivity changes of the submerged vegetation of Lake Karakul, Pamir Mountains (Tajikistan), using sedimentary ancient DNA metabarcoding and elemental (C/N) and isotopic (d13C, d15N) measurements of Stuckenia cf. pamirica (Baagøe) Z. Kaplan (Potamogetonaceae) leaf remains. No Stuckenia cf. pamirica leaf remains were found for 28.7–26.1 cal ka BP, when both Potamogetonaceae and Chara (L.) DNA sequences were recorded, suggesting sparse submerged vegetation at the coring site. This agrees with the inference of a deep lake reached using geochemical proxies. From 26.1 to 17.5 cal ka BP a few macrophyte remains and high numbers of Potamogetonaceae sequences were recovered: lake level was probably low, as suggested by other studies on the lake. Another phase of increased numbers of Chara sequences and the absence of Stuckenia cf. pamirica leaf remains was found between 17.5 and 12.2 cal ka BP, which coincides with a lake-level transgression at Lake Karakul as indicated by paleo-shoreline investigations. Analyses of macrophyte remains reveal intermediate paleo-productivity from 6.9 cal ka BP and high paleo-productivity from 2.2 cal ka BP onwards. From comparisons with other studies, we suggest that lake-level changes are the main driver for the submerged vegetation composition and productivity at the coring site in Lake Karakul and underline our conclusions by depicting the present-day distribution of Stuckenia cf. pamirica and Chara within the lake.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Arid central Asia | Chara/Characeae | Metabarcoding | Paleo-productivity | Potamogeton/Stuckenia | Submerged vegetation composition","13937","15-2","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","0","FALSE","704","58","3",NA,NA,"DFG",NA,2017

This study tests whether pH affects the diversity and structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic algal communities associated with skeletons of Porites spp. using targeted amplicon (16S rRNA gene, UPA and tufA) sequencing. We found that the composition of endolithic communities in the massive coral Porites spp. inhabiting a naturally high pCO2 reef (avg. pCO2 811 µatm) is not significantly different from corals inhabiting reference sites (avg. pCO2 357 µatm), suggesting that these microbiomes are less disturbed by OA than previously thought. Possible explanations may be that the endolithic microhabitat is highly homeostatic or that the endolithic micro-organisms are well adapted to a wide pH range. Some of the microbial taxa identified include nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Rhizobiales and cyanobacteria), algicidal bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes, symbiotic bacteria in the family Endozoicomoniaceae, and endolithic green algae, considered the major microbial agent of reef bioerosion. Additionally, we test whether host species has an effect on the endolithic community structure.

Bacterial dysbiosis might be involved in the activation of nociceptive sensory pathways, but there have been few studies of the role of the mycobiome (the fungal microbiome) in the development of IBS. We analyzed intestinal mycobiomes of patients with IBS and a rat model of visceral hypersensitivity. Methods We used internal transcribed spacer 1-based metabarcoding to compare fecal mycobiomes of 18 healthy volunteers with those of 39 patients with IBS (with visceral hypersensitivity or normal levels of sensitivity). We also compared the mycobiomes of Long-Evans rats separated from their mothers (hypersensitive) with non-handled (normally sensitive) rats. We investigated whether fungi can cause visceral hypersensitivity using rats exposed to fungicide (fluconazole and nystatin). The functional relevance of the gut mycobiome was confirmed in fecal transplantation experiments: adult maternally separated rats were subjected to water avoidance stress (to induce visceral hypersensitivity), then given fungicide and donor cecum content via oral gavage. Other rats subjected to water avoidance stress were given soluble ß-glucans, which antagonize C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC7A or DECTIN1) signaling via spleen-associated tyrosine kinase (SYK), a SYK inhibitor to reduce visceral hypersensitivity, or vehicle (control). The sensitivity of mast cells to fungi was tested with mesenteric windows (ex vivo) and the human mast cell line HMC-1. Results a diversity (Shannon index) and mycobiome signature (stability selection) of both groups of IBS patients differed from healthy volunteers, and the mycobiome signature of hypersensitive patients differed from that of normally sensitive patients. We observed mycobiome dysbiosis in rats that had been separated from their mothers compared with non-handled rats. Administration of fungicide to hypersensitive rats reduced their visceral hypersensitivity to normal levels of sensitivity. Administration of cecal mycobiomes from rats that had been separated from their mothers (but not non-handled mycobiome) restored hypersensitivity to distension. Administration of soluble ß-glucans or a SYK inhibitor reduced visceral hypersensitivity, compared with controls. Particulate ß-glucan (a DECTIN-1 agonist) induced mast cell degranulation in mesenteric windows and HMC-1 cells responded to fungal antigens by release of histamine. Conclusions In an analysis of patients with IBS and controls, we associated fungal dysbiosis with IBS. In studies of rats, we found fungi to promote visceral hypersensitivity, which could be reduced by administration of fungicides, soluble ß-glucans, or a SYK inhibitor. The intestinal fungi might therefore be manipulated for treatment of IBS-related visceral hypersensitivity.","22","Journal","ar","Article","100","14","Dectin-1 | Immune Response | Mycobiota | Yeast","28330","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","706","153","4","28624575",NA,NA,"S0016508517357384",2017

DNA barcoding methods originally developed for the identification of plant specimens have been applied to the authentication of herbal drug materials for industrial quality assurance. These methods are intended to be complementary to current morphological and chemical methods of identification. The adoption of these methods by industry will be accelerated by the introduction of DNA-based identification techniques into regulatory standards and monographs. The introduction of DNA methods into the British Pharmacopoeia is described, along with a reference standard for use as a positive control for DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A general troubleshooting chart is provided to guide the user through the problems that may be encountered during this process. Nevertheless, the nature of the plant materials and the demands of industrial quality control procedures mean that conventional DNA barcoding is not the method of choice for industrial quality control. The design of DNA barcode-targeted quantitative PCR and high resolution melt curve tests is one strategy for developing rapid, robust, and reliable protocols for high-throughput screening of raw materials. The development of authentication tests for wild-harvested Rhodiola rosea L. is used as a case study to exemplify these relatively simple tests.

Information on the diversity of fungal spores in air is limited, and also the content of airborne spores of fungal plant pathogens is understudied. In the present study, a total of 152 air samples were taken from rooftops at urban settings in Slagelse, DK, Wageningen NL, and Rothamsted, UK together with 41 samples from above oilseed rape fields in Rothamsted. Samples were taken during 10-day periods in spring and autumn, each sample representing 1 day of sampling. The fungal content of samples was analyzed by metabarcoding of the fungal internal transcribed sequence 1 (ITS1) and by qPCR for specific fungi. The metabarcoding results demonstrated that season had significant effects on airborne fungal communities. In contrast, location did not have strong effects on the communities, even though locations were separated by up to 900 km. Also, a number of plant pathogens had strikingly similar patterns of abundance at the three locations. Rooftop samples were more diverse than samples taken above fields, probably reflecting greater mixing of air from a range of microenvironments for the rooftop sites. Pathogens that were known to be present in the crop were also found in air samples taken above the field. This paper is one of the first detailed studies of fungal composition in air with the focus on plant pathogens and shows that it is possible to detect a range of pathogens in rooftop air samplers using metabarcoding.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Air sampling | Airborne | Metabarcoding | Plant pathogen | Urban","21100226442","265865-PURE","Rothamsted Research","1","TRUE","714","8","SEP",NA,"1729","BBSRC",NA,2017

Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. die-back is a widely-studied phenomenon that was first discovered in northern Europe and that, until recently, was almost unknown in the Mediterranean basin. It has been described as a complex syndrome affecting reed populations leading to their retreat and decline, with significant impacts on valuable ecosystem services. Among the factors that cause the decline, soil-living microorganisms can be crucial. The aims of this study were to analyze the diversity of oomycetes communities associated with reed stands, and to understand whether they could play a key role in the decline. Variations in the structure of oomycetes communities were studied by metabarcoding of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 region of ribosomal DNA, from the sediments of five Italian freshwater ecosystems. They were chosen to cover a large variability in terms of surface area, water depth, microclimate, and presence of documented reed retreat. From 96 samples collected from reed roots, rhizosphere, and bulk soil, we assembled 207661 ITS1 reads into 523 OTUs. We demonstrated that oomycete communities were structured by several factors, among which the most important was die-back occurrence. Our study also indicates that Pythiogeton spp. could be potentially involved in the development of die-back. The role of heavy metals in the soil was also explored, and cadmium concentration was shown to affect oomycetes distribution. This study represents a significant step forward for the characterization of microbial communities associated with reed die-back syndrome and helps to gain knowledge of the complexity of these important wet ecosystems.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","12","Common reed | Freshwater ecosystem | Metabarcoding | Microbial ecology | Phragmites australis | Rhizosphere | Wetlands","21100313905","RBFR13P7PR",NA,"1","TRUE","715","8",NA,NA,"1550",NA,NA,2017

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Environmental bulk samples often contain many different taxa that vary several orders of magnitude in biomass. This can be problematic in DNA metabarcoding and metagenomic high-throughput sequencing approaches, as large specimens contribute disproportionately high amounts of DNA template. Thus, a few specimens of high biomass will dominate the dataset, potentially leading to smaller specimens remaining undetected. Sorting of samples by specimen size (as a proxy for biomass) and balancing the amounts of tissue used per size fraction should improve detection rates, but this approach has not been systematically tested. Here, we explored the effects of size sorting on taxa detection using two freshwater macroinvertebrate bulk samples, collected from a low-mountain stream in Germany. Specimens were morphologically identified and sorted into three size classes (body size < 2.5 × 5, 5 × 10, and up to 10 × 20 mm). Tissue powder from each size category was extracted individually and pooled based on tissue weight to simulate samples that were not sorted by biomass (“Unsorted”). Additionally, size fractions were pooled so that each specimen contributed approximately equal amounts of biomass (“Sorted”). Mock samples were amplified using four different DNA metabarcoding primer sets targeting the Cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. Sorting taxa by size and pooling them proportionately according to their abundance lead to a more equal amplification of taxa compared to the processing of complete samples without sorting. The sorted samples recovered 30% more taxa than the unsorted samples at the same sequencing depth. Our results imply that sequencing depth can be decreased approximately fivefold when sorting the samples into three size classes and pooling by specimen abundance. Even coarse size sorting can substantially improve taxa detection using DNA metabarcoding. While high-throughput sequencing will become more accessible and cheaper within the next years, sorting bulk samples by specimen biomass or size is a simple yet efficient method to reduce current sequencing costs.","20","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","biomass bias | DNA barcoding | ecosystem assessment | metabarcoding | metagenomics | size sorting","21100264002","CA15219",NA,"1","TRUE","717","7","17",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

This study investigated the genetic diversity of phytoplankton communities in six shallow lagoons located on the French coast of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea that represented a trophic gradient ranging from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic. The phytoplankton communities were sampled once a month from spring (May) to the beginning of autumn (September/early October) in 2012 and fractionated by size. Metabarcodes were generated from cDNAs by targeting the D1-D2 region of the 28S rRNA gene and pyrosequenced using Roche 454 technology. Examination of the annotated barcodes revealed harmful algal species not previously documented in these lagoons. Three ichthyotoxic species belonging to Pfiesteriaceae were detected: Luciella masanensis was relatively widespread and abundant in many samples, whereas Pfiesteria piscicida and Stoeckeria changwonensis were found as single barcode sequences. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis of barcodes annotated as belonging to Pfiesteriaceae suggested the existence of two previously undescribed clades. The other toxic or potentially harmful dinoflagellates detected through rare barcodes were Dinophysis acuminata, Vulcanodinium rugosum, Alexandrium andersonii and A. ostenfeldii. The two most abundant dinoflagellate taxa were Gymnodinium litoralis and Akashiwo sanguinea with respect to sequence numbers. Four diatom species from the genus Pseudo-nitzschia that potentially produce domoic acid were identified (P. galaxiae, P. delicatissima, P. brasiliana and P. calliantha).

Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a powerful noninvasive tool for species detection. However, most eDNA survey methods have been developed and applied in temperate zones. We tested the feasibility of using eDNA to survey anurans in tropical streams in the Brazilian Atlantic forest and compared the results with short-term visual and audio surveys. We detected all nine species known to inhabit our focal streams with one single visit for eDNA sampling. We found a higher proportion of sequence reads and larger number of positive PCR replicates for more common species and for those with life cycles closely associated with the streams, factors that may contribute to increased release of DNA in the water. However, less common species were also detected in eDNA samples, demonstrating the detection power of this method. Filtering larger volumes of water resulted in a higher probability of detection. Our data also show it is important to sample multiple sites along streams, particularly for detection of target species with lower population densities. For the three focal species in our study, the eDNA metabarcoding method had a greater capacity of detection per sampling event than our rapid field surveys, and thus, has the potential to circumvent some of the challenges associated with traditional approaches. Our results underscore the utility of eDNA metabarcoding as an efficient method to survey anuran species in tropical streams of the highly biodiverse Brazilian Atlantic forest.","13","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","12S mitochondrial gene | amphibians | biodiversity | monitoring methods | next-generation sequencing | site occupancy–detection modelling","11700154306","401729/ 2013-3","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico","0","FALSE","719","17","5","27987263",NA,NA,NA,2017

Biota monitoring in ports is increasingly needed for biosecurity reasons and safeguarding marine biodiversity from biological invasion. Present and future international biosecurity directives can be accomplished only if the biota acquired by maritime traffic in ports is controlled. Methodologies for biota inventory are diverse and now rely principally on extensive and labor-intensive sampling along with taxonomic identification by experts. In this study, we employed an extremely simplified environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling methodology from only three 1-L bottles of water per port, followed by metabarcoding (high-throughput sequencing and DNA-based species identification) using 18S rDNA and Cytochrome oxidase I as genetic barcodes. Eight Bay of Biscay ports with available inventory of fouling invertebrates were employed as a case study. Despite minimal sampling efforts, three invasive invertebrates were detected: the barnacle Austrominius modestus, the tubeworm Ficopomatus enigmaticus and the polychaete Polydora triglanda. The same species have been previously found from visual and DNA barcoding (genetic identification of individuals) surveys in the same ports. The current costs of visual surveys, conventional DNA barcoding and this simplified metabarcoding protocol were compared. The results encourage the use of metabarcoding for early biosecurity alerts.","9","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"10600153309","CGL-2013-42415-R","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad","1","TRUE","720","12","9","28873426","e0183347","MINECO",NA,2017

However, the diets of key predator groups like seabirds have conventionally been assessed from stomach content analyses, which cannot detect most gelatinous prey. As marine top predators are used to identify changes in the overall species composition of marine ecosystems, such biases in dietary assessment may impact our detection of important ecosystem regime shifts. We investigated albatross diet using DNA metabarcoding of scats to assess the prevalence of gelatinous zooplankton consumption by two albatross species, one of which is used as an indicator species for ecosystem monitoring. Black-browed and Campbell albatross scats were collected from eight breeding colonies covering the circumpolar range of these birds over two consecutive breeding seasons. Fish was the main dietary item at most sites; however, cnidarian DNA, primarily from scyphozoan jellyfish, was present in 42% of samples overall and up to 80% of samples at some sites. Jellyfish was detected during all breeding stages and consumed by adults and chicks. Trawl fishery catches of jellyfish near the Falkland Islands indicate a similar frequency of jellyfish occurrence in albatross diets in years of high and low jellyfish availability, suggesting jellyfish consumption may be selective rather than opportunistic. Warmer oceans and overfishing of finfish are predicted to favour jellyfish population increases, and we demonstrate here that dietary DNA metabarcoding enables measurements of the contribution of gelatinous zooplankton to the diet of marine predators.","16","Journal","ar","Article","100","13","climate change | cnidarians | faeces | food | indicator species | scats | seabird","20297","UID/MAR/04292/2013","Fuel Cell Technologies Program","0","FALSE","721","26","18","28734075",NA,"FCT",NA,2017

Because the degree of specificity towards the lichen host is poorly known, we studied the diversity of these fungi among neighbouring lichens on rocks in an alpine habitat. Using a sequencing metabarcoding approach, we show that lichen mycobiomes clearly reflect the overlap of multiple ecological sets of taxa, which differ in their trophic association with lichen thalli. The lack of specificity to the lichen mycobiome is further supported by the lack of community structure observed using clustering and ordination methods. The communities encountered across samples largely result from the subsampling of a shared species pool, in which we identify three major ecological components: (i) a generalist environmental pool, (ii) a lichenicolous/endolichenic pool and (iii) a pool of transient species. These taxa majorly belong to the fungal classes Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Tremellomycetes with close relatives in adjacent ecological niches. We found no significant evidence that the phenotypically recognized lichenicolous fungi influence the occurrence of the other asymptomatic fungi in the host thalli. We claim that lichens work as suboptimal habitats or as a complex spore and mycelium bank, which modulate and allow the regeneration of local fungal communities.

To address this, we analysed the eukaryotic plankton communities both with, and without, prefiltering with a 200 µm pore-size sieve –by using SSU rDNA-based high-throughput sequencing on 16 samples with three replicates in each sample from two subtropical reservoirs sampled from January to October in 2013.

We further found that both >0.2 µm and 0.2–200 µm eukaryotic plankton communities, especially the abundant plankton subcommunities, exhibited very similar, and synchronous, spatiotemporal patterns and processes associated with almost identical environmental drivers. The lack of an effect on community structure from prefiltering suggests that environmental DNA from larger metazoa is introduced into the smaller size class. Therefore, size-fractionated filtering with 200 µm is insufficient to discriminate between the eukaryotic plankton size groups in metabarcoding approaches.

Plants are usually visited by a number of different animal species, which in turn may visit flowers of several plant species. Therefore, the identification of the pollen carried by flower visitors is an essential first step in pollination biology. The skill and time required to identify pollen based on structure and morphology has been a major stumbling block in this field. Advances in the genetic analysis of DNA, using DNA barcoding, extracted directly from pollen offers an innovative alternative to traditional methods of pollen identification. This technique, which is reviewed in detail, can be used on pollen loads sampled from bees in the field and from specimens in historic collections. Here the importance of pollination, the role-players involved, their management and the evolution of their interactions, behaviour and morphology are reviewed – with a special focus on South African bees. Significance: Pollen metabarcoding will enable the identification of pollen for a multitude of uses, including agriculture, conservation and forensics.

We used DNA metabarcoding to compare taxonomic and functional composition of fungal communities along a gradient of environmental severity in Northeast Greenland. We analysed soil samples from fell fields, heaths and snowbeds, three habitats with very contrasting abiotic conditions. We also assessed within-habitat differences by comparing three widespread microhabitats (patches with high cover of Dryas, Salix, or bare soil). The data suggest that, along the sampled mesotopographic gradient, the greatest differences in both fungal richness and community composition are observed amongst habitats, while the effect of microhabitat is weaker, although still significant. Furthermore, we found that richness and community composition of fungi are shaped primarily by abiotic factors and to a lesser, though still significant extent, by floristic composition. Along this mesotopographic gradient, environmental severity is strongly correlated with richness in all fungal functional groups: positively in saprotrophic, pathogenic and lichenised fungi, and negatively in ectomycorrhizal and root endophytic fungi. Our results suggest complex interactions amongst functional groups, possibly due to nutrient limitation or competitive exclusion, with potential implications on soil carbon stocks.

Harnessing information encoded in environmental DNA (eDNA) in marine waters has the potential to revolutionize marine biomonitoring. Whether using organism-specific quantitative PCR assays or metabarcoding in conjunction with amplicon sequencing, scientists have illustrated that realistic organism censuses can be inferred from eDNA. The next step is establishing ways to link information obtained from eDNA analyses to actual organism abundance. This is only possible by understanding the processes that control eDNA concentrations. The present study uses mesocosm experiments to study the persistence of eDNA in marine waters and explore the role of sunlight in modulating eDNA persistence. We seeded solute-permeable dialysis bags with water containing indigenous eDNA and suspended them in a large tank containing seawater. Bags were subjected to two treatments: half the bags were suspended near the water surface where they received high doses of sunlight, and half at depth where they received lower doses of sunlight. Bags were destructively sampled over the course of 87 hours. eDNA was extracted from water samples and used as template for a Scomber japonicus qPCR assay and a marine fish-specific 12S rRNA PCR assay. The latter was subsequently sequenced using a metabarcoding approach. S. japonicus eDNA, as measured by qPCR, exhibited first order decay with a rate constant ~0.01 hr -1 with no difference in decay rate constants between the two experimental treatments. eDNA metabarcoding identified 190 organizational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to varying taxonomic ranks. There was no difference in marine fish communities as measured by eDNA metabarcoding between the two experimental treatments, but there was an effect of time. Given the differences in UVA and UVB fluence received by the two experimental treatments, we conclude that sunlight is not the main driver of fish eDNA decay in the experiments. However, there are clearly temporal effects that need to be considered when interpreting information obtained using eDNA approaches.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"10600153309","undefined","Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment","1","TRUE","726","12","9","28915253","e0185043",NA,NA,2017

The nature and extent of interactions between seabirds and fisheries vary, as does the level and efficacy of management and mitigation. Seabird dietary studies provide information on prey diversity and often identify species that are also caught in fisheries, providing evidence of linkages which can be used to improve ecosystem based management of fisheries. However, species identification of fish can be difficult with conventional dietary techniques. The black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) has a circumpolar distribution and has suffered major population declines due primarily to incidental mortality in fisheries. We use DNA metabarcoding of black-browed albatross scats to investigate their fish prey during the breeding season at six sites across their range, over two seasons. We identify the spatial and temporal diversity of fish in their diets and overlaps with fisheries operating in adjacent waters. Across all sites, 51 fish species from 33 families were identified, with 23 species contributing >10% of the proportion of samples or sequences at any site. There was extensive geographic variation but little inter-annual variability in fish species consumed. Several fish species that are not easily accessible to albatross, but are commercially harvested or by-caught, were detected in the albatross diet during the breeding season. This was particularly evident at the Falkland Islands and Iles Kerguelen where higher fishery catch amounts (or discard amounts where known) corresponded to higher occurrence of these species in diet samples. This study indicates ongoing interactions with fisheries through consumption of fishery discards, increasing the risk of seabird mortality. Breeding success was higher at sites where fisheries discards were detected in the diet, highlighting the need to minimize discarding to reduce impacts on the ecosystem. DNA metabarcoding provides a valuable non-invasive tool for assessing the fish prey of seabirds across broad geographic ranges. This provides an avenue for fishery resource managers to assess compliance of fisheries with discard policies and the level of interaction with scavenging seabirds.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","14","Fish diversity | Fisheries resource management | Scat | Seabird-fishery interaction | Seabirds | Southern ocean | Thalassarche melanophris | Trawl fishery","21100790929","UID/MAR/04292/2013","Wildlife Conservation Society","1","TRUE","727","4","AUG",NA,"277","FCT",NA,2017

Precision and reliability of barcode-based biodiversity assessment can be affected at several steps during acquisition and analysis of data. Identification of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is one of the crucial steps in the process and can be accomplished using several different approaches, namely, alignment-based, probabilistic, tree-based and phylogenybased. The number of identified sequences in the reference databases affects the precision of identification. This paper compares the identification of marine nematode OTUs using alignment-based, tree-based and phylogeny-based approaches. Because the nematode reference dataset is limited in its taxonomic scope, OTUs can only be assigned to higher taxonomic categories, families. The phylogeny-based approach using the evolutionary placement algorithm provided the largest number of positively assigned OTUs and was least affected by erroneous sequences and limitations of reference data, compared to alignment-based and tree-based approaches.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Barcode | Biodiversity | Identification | Meiobenthos | Metabarcoding | Nematodes","21100446014","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","728","4","8",NA,"170315",NA,NA,2017

Monitoring biodiversity is essential to assess the impacts of increasing anthropogenic activities in marine environments. Traditionally, marine biomonitoring involves the sorting and morphological identification of benthic macro-invertebrates, which is time-consuming and taxonomic-expertise demanding. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (eDNA metabarcoding) represents a promising alternative for benthic monitoring. However, an important fraction of eDNA sequences remains unassigned or belong to taxa of unknown ecology, which prevent their use for assessing the ecological quality status. Here, we show that supervised machine learning (SML) can be used to build robust predictive models for benthic monitoring, regardless of the taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences. We tested three SML approaches to assess the environmental impact of marine aquaculture using benthic foraminifera eDNA, a group of unicellular eukaryotes known to be good bioindicators, as features to infer macro-invertebrates based biotic indices. We found similar ecological status as obtained from macro-invertebrates inventories. We argue that SML approaches could overcome and even bypass the cost and time-demanding morpho-taxonomic approaches in future biomonitoring.","26","Journal","ar","Article","100","8",NA,"21537","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","729","51","16","28665601",NA,NA,NA,2017

The plant diversity recovered through sedDNA from Lake Sele showed a specific local signal and limited overlapping with pollen. Introduced plants, grown and cultivated close to the water, such as sweet potato, were also well recorded by sedDNA.

Very little is known about the composition and the annual cycle of zooplankton assemblages in the Red Sea, a confined water body characterized by a high biodiversity and endemism but at the same time one of the most understudied areas in the world in terms of marine biodiversity. This high diversity together with the lack of references for several of the groups poses a problem in obtaining basic information on zooplankton seasonal patterns. In the present work, we used high throughput sequencing to examine the temporal and spatial distribution of the zooplankton communities inhabiting the epipelagic zone in the central Red Sea. The analysis of zooplankton assemblages collected at two sites-coastal and offshore-twice a month at several depth strata by using MANTA, Bongo and WP2 nets provides baseline information of the seasonal patterns of the zooplankton community over 1 year. We show that the seasonal fluctuation of zooplankton communities living in the upper 100 m of the water column is driven mainly by the annual changes in seawater temperature. The 18S rRNA gene was used for metabarcoding of zooplankton assemblages revealing 630 metazoan OTUs (97% similarity) in five phyla, highlighting the richness of the Red Sea community. During colder months, communities were characterized by lower richness and higher biomass than communities found during the hot season. Throughout the year the zooplankton communities were dominated by the class Maxillopoda, mainly represented by copepods and class Hydrozoa. The rise in the water temperature favors the appearance of classes Malacostraca, Cephalopoda, Gastropoda, and Saggitoidea.

DNA metabarcoding is increasingly being used to characterize the microbiological composition of both the indoor and outdoor environments of dwellings. Our study aimed to evaluate metabarcoding and bioinformatic analysis resulting from calibrated samples and samples collected by an electrostatic dust collector (EDC) in dwellings with no moisture problems. Thus, the fungal communities of 14 dwellings (eastern France, Franche-Comté region) were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq technology after amplification of the ITS2 region. Using the standard samples of 11 species of yeasts and molds allowed us to validate the Operational taxonomic units (OTU) assignment. These calibrated samples also showed a low amplification bias, a low rate of sequencing errors and the semi-quantitative nature of the technique. Only one species from the calibrated samples (Lichtheimia corymbifera) was less amplified probably due to the presence of two mismatches in its3 primer. EDC analysis identified 3594 OTU with 75% of reads corresponding to 30 genera. The main genera are those usually found by culture techniques (Penicillium, Aspergillus and Cladosporium), but findings also indicate others less commonly isolated in culture such as Epicoccum, the fourth detected genus in our study. The type of heating systems was correlated with fungal diversity. We found less diversity in the dwellings with wood heating and larger quantities of Epicoccum nigrum verified by qPCR. DNA metabarcoding analysis applied to EDC seems promising. However, we think that it must be used along with qPCR, to obtain a more global view of microbial ecology and relative quantification of species of interest within communities.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Fungal community | Illumina sequencing | Indoor dust | Metabarcoding | qPCR","20235","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","733","139",NA,"28559161",NA,NA,"S0167701217301240",2017

Published by Oxford University Press. Southeast (SE) Asia is 1 of the most biodiverse regions in the world, and it holds approximately 20% of all mammal species. Despite this, the majority of SE Asia's genetic diversity is still poorly characterized. The growing interest in using environmental DNA to assess and monitor SE Asian species, in particular threatened mammals-has created the urgent need to expand the available reference database of mitochondrial barcode and complete mitogenome sequences. We have partially addressed this need by generating 72 new mitogenome sequences reconstructed from DNA isolated from a range of historical and modern tissue samples. Approximately 55 gigabases of raw sequence were generated. From this data, we assembled 72 complete mitogenome sequences, with an average depth of coverage of ×102.9 and ×55.2 for modern samples and historical samples, respectively. This dataset represents 52 species, of which 30 species had no previous mitogenome data available. The mitogenomes were geotagged to their sampling location, where known, to display a detailed geographical distribution of the species. Our new database of 52 taxa will strongly enhance the utility of environmental DNA approaches for monitoring mammals in SE Asia as it greatly increases the likelihoods that identification of metabarcoding sequencing reads can be assigned to reference sequences. This magnifies the confidence in species detections and thus allows more robust surveys and monitoring programmes of SE Asia's threatened mammal biodiversity. The extensive collections of historical samples from SE Asia in western and SE Asian museums should serve as additional valuable material to further enrich this reference database.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","16","GenBanktaxonomic assignment | Invertebrate-derived (iDNA) | Metabarcoding","21100420802","FKZ: 01LN1301A","Lundbeckfonden","1","TRUE","735","6","8","28873965","gix053",NA,NA,2017

For these reasons we sought to develop a Quantitative PCR assay that would detect all species from both Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa genera in order to rapidly screen environmental samples for potentially toxic species. Additionally, a specific assay for F. paulensis was developed as this species is of concern in New Zealand coastal waters.

The availability of pollen in agricultural landscapes is essential for the successful growth and reproduction of honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera L.). The quantity and diversity of collected pollen can influence the growth and health of honey bee colonies, but little is known about the influence of landscape structure on pollen diet. In a field experiment, we rotated 16 honey bee colonies across 16 agricultural landscapes, used traps to collect samples of collected pollen and observed intra-colonial dance communication to gain information about foraging distances. DNA metabarcoding was applied to analyze mixed pollen samples. Neither the amount of collected pollen nor pollen diversity was related to landscape diversity. However, we found a strong seasonal variation in the amount and diversity of collected pollen in all sites independent of landscape diversity. The observed increase in foraging distances with decreasing landscape diversity suggests that honey bees compensated for lower landscape diversity by increasing their pollen foraging range in order to maintain pollen amount and diversity. Our results underscore the importance of a diverse pollen diet for honey bee colonies. Agri-environmental schemes aiming to support pollinators should focus on possible spatial and temporal gaps in pollen availability and diversity in agricultural landscapes.","8","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"10600153309","289706","European Commission","1","TRUE","737","12","8","28854210","e0183716","EC",NA,2017

We investigated 4.5 million high-quality protistan metabarcodes (V4 region of the SSU rDNA) obtained from 24 shallow salt ponds (salinities 4%–44%) from South America and Europe. Statistical analyses of protistan community profiles identified four salinity classes, which strongly selected for different protistan communities: 4–9%, 14–24%, 27–36% and 38–44%. The proportion of organisms unknown to science is highest in the 14–24% salinity class, showing that environments within this salinity range are an unappreciated reservoir of as yet undiscovered organisms. Distinct higher-rank taxon groups dominated in the four salinity classes in terms of diversity. As increasing salinities require different cellular responses to cope with salt, our results suggest that different evolutionary lineages of protists have evolved distinct haloadaptation strategies. Salinity appears to be a stronger selection factor for the structuring of protistan communities than geography. Yet, we find a higher degree of endemism in shallow salt ponds compared with less isolated ecosystems such as the open ocean.

However, for many communities including ecologically crucial ones such as zooplankton, it is largely unknown how different communities respond to environmental pollution. Collectively, dispersal and species sorting are two competing processes in determining the structure and geographical distribution of zooplankton communities in running water ecosystems such as rivers. At fine geographical scales, dispersal is usually considered as the dominant factor; however, the relative role of species sorting has not been evaluated well, mainly because significant environmental gradients rarely exist along continuously flowing rivers. The Chaobai River in northern China represents a rare system, where a significant environmental gradient exists at fine scales. Here, we employed high-throughput sequencing to characterize complex zooplankton communities collected from the Chaobai River, and tested the relative roles of dispersal and species sorting in determining zooplankton community structure along the pollution gradient. Our results showed distinct patterns of zooplankton communities along the environmental gradient, and chemical pollutant-related factors such as total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a were identified as the major drivers for the observed patterns. Further partial redundancy analyses showed that species sorting overrode the effect of dispersal to shape local zooplankton community structure.

The environmental experience of plants can modulate the development of the offspring and their interactions with other organisms. These effects, generally known as maternal effects, occur through seed provisioning and epigenetic modifications. This study considers the influence of differing environments of maternal plants on their progeny and their biotic interactions. Seeds were collected from two Eucalyptus grandis clonal seed orchards having different abiotic and biotic conditions. Seed and seedling development, and seedling responses to pest infestation and pathogen inoculation were measured. Finally, fungal communities in the foliage of the seedlings were assessed using a metabarcoding approach. The percentage of seed germination and height of seedlings were influenced by the maternal environments. Seedlings from one of the maternal environments were significantly more resistant to a pathogen than seedlings from the other.

Chikanda is a traditional dish made with wild-harvested ground orchid tubers belonging to three orchidioid genera, Disa, Satyrium and Habenaria, all of which are CITES appendix II-listed. Identification of collected orchid tubers is very difficult and documentation of constituent species in prepared chikanda has hitherto been impossible. Here amplicon metabarcoding was used in samples of six prepared chikanda cakes to study genetic sequence diversity and species diversity in this product. Molecular operational taxonomic unit identification using similarity-matching reveals that species of all three genera were present in the chikanda samples studied. Disa was present in all of the samples, Satyrium in five out of six and Habenaria in one of the samples, as well as a number of other plants. The fact that each sample contained orchids and the presence of a wide variety of species from all genera in this traditional dish raise serious concerns about the sustainability of this trade and the future of wild orchid populations in the main harvest areas. This proof-of-concept study shows that Ion-Torrent PGM is a cost-effective scalable platform for metabarcoding using the relatively long nrITS1 and nrITS2 regions. Furthermore, nrITS metabarcoding can be successfully used for the detection of specific ingredients in a highly-processed food product at genus level, and this makes it a useful tool in the detection of possible conservation issues arising from commercialized trade or processed plant products.","8","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","CITES | Disa | Ethnobotany | Habenaria | Ion-Torrent PGM | Satyrium | Wildlife forensics","17242","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","744","26","9",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Root exudation contributes to soil carbon allocation and also to microbial C and energy supply, which subsequently impacts soil aggregation around roots. Biologically-driven soil structural formation is an important driver of soil fertility. Plant genetic determinants of exudation and more generally of factors promoting rhizosphere soil aggregation are largely unknown. Here, we characterized rhizosphere aggregation in a panel of 86 pearl millet inbred lines using a ratio of root-adhering soil dry mass per root tissue dry mass (RAS/RT). This ratio showed significant variations between lines, with a roughly 2-fold amplitude between lowest and highest average values. For 9 lines with contrasting aggregation properties, we then compared the bacterial diversity and composition in root-adhering soil. Bacterial a-diversity metrics increased with the “RAS/RT ratio.” Regarding taxonomic composition, the Rhizobiales were stimulated in lines showing high aggregation level whereas Bacillales were more abundant in lines with low ratio. 184 strains of cultivable exopolysaccharides-producing bacteria have been isolated from the rhizosphere of some lines, including members fromRhizobiales and Bacillales. However, at this stage, we could not find a correlation between abundance of EPS-producing species in bacterial communities and the ratio RAS/RT. These results illustrated the impact of cereals genetic trait variation on soil physical properties and microbial diversity. This opens the possibility of considering plant breeding to help management of soil carbon content and physical characteristics through carbon rhizodeposition in soil.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","15","16S rDNA sequencing | EPS producing bacteria | Metabarcoding | Pearl millet | Rhizosheath | Rhizosphere | Soil aggregation","21100313905","AF 1301-015","Agropolis Fondation","1","TRUE","745","8",NA,NA,"1288",NA,NA,2017

Background: Bats are a highly successful, globally dispersed order of mammals that occupy a wide array of ecological niches. They are also intensely parasitized and implicated in multiple viral, bacterial and parasitic zoonosis. Trypanosomes are thought to be especially abundant and diverse in bats. In this study, we used 18S ribosomal RNA metabarcoding to probe bat trypanosome diversity in unprecedented detail. Methodology/Principal Findings: Total DNA was extracted from the blood of 90 bat individuals (17 species) captured along Atlantic Forest fragments of Espírito Santo state, southeast Brazil. The 18S ribosomal RNA was amplified by standard and/or nested PCR, then deep sequenced to recover and identify Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for phylogenetic analysis. Blood samples from 34 bat individuals (13 species) tested positive for infection by 18S rRNA amplification. Amplicon sequences clustered to 14 OTUs, of which five identified as Trypanosoma cruzi I, T. cruzi III/V, Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei, Trypanosoma rangeli, and Trypanosoma dionisii, and seven identified as novel genotypes monophyletic to basal T. cruzi clade types of the New World. Another OTU was identified as a trypanosome like those found in reptiles. Surprisingly, the remaining OTU was identified as Bodo saltans–closest non-parasitic relative of the trypanosomatid order. While three blood samples featured just one OTU (T. dionisii), all others resolved as mixed infections of up to eight OTUs. Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates the utility of next-generation barcoding methods to screen parasite diversity in mammalian reservoir hosts. We exposed high rates of local bat parasitism by multiple trypanosome species, some known to cause fatal human disease, others non-pathogenic, novel or yet little understood. Our results highlight bats as a long-standing nexus among host-parasite interactions of multiple niches, sustained in part by opportunistic and incidental infections of consequence to evolutionary theory as much as to public health.","11","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"11900154404","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","746","11","7","28727769","e0005790",NA,NA,2017

Thus, far, bacterial biofilm formation had only been studied after short-term exposure or on floating plastic, yet a prominent share of plastic litter accumulates on the seafloor. In this study, we explored the taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal communities on polyethylene plastic sheets and dolly ropes during long-term exposure on the seafloor, both at a harbor and an offshore location in the Belgian part of the North Sea. We reconstructed the sequence of events during biofilm formation on plastic in the harbor environment and identified a core bacteriome and subsets of bacterial indicator species for early, intermediate, and late stages of biofilm formation. Additionally, by implementing ITS2 metabarcoding on plastic debris, we identified and characterized for the first time fungal genera on plastic debris. Surprisingly, none of the plastics exposed to offshore conditions displayed the typical signature of a late stage biofilm, suggesting that biofilm formation is severely hampered in the natural environment where most plastic debris accumulates.","15","Journal","ar","Article","100","8",NA,"21537","undefined","Universiteit Gent","0","FALSE","747","51","13","28562015",NA,NA,NA,2017

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. The analysis of apex predator diet has the ability to deliver valuable insights into ecosystem health, and the potential impacts a predator might have on commercially relevant species. The Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) is an endemic apex predator and one of the world's most endangered pinnipeds. Given that prey availability is vital to the survival of top predators, this study set out to understand what dietary information DNA metabarcoding could yield from 36 sea lion scats collected across 1,500 km of its distribution in southwest Western Australia. A combination of PCR assays were designed to target a variety of potential sea lion prey, including mammals, fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and birds. Over 1.2 million metabarcodes identified six classes from three phyla, together representing over 80 taxa. The results confirm that the Australian sea lion is a wide-ranging opportunistic predator that consumes an array of mainly demersal fauna. Further, the important commercial species Sepioteuthis australis (southern calamari squid) and Panulirus cygnus (western rock lobster) were detected, but were present in <25% of samples. Some of the taxa identified, such as fish, sharks and rays, clarify previous knowledge of sea lion prey, and some, such as eel taxa and two gastropod species, represent new dietary insights. Even with modest sample sizes, a spatial analysis of taxa and operational taxonomic units found within the scat shows significant differences in diet between many of the sample locations and identifies the primary taxa that are driving this variance. This study provides new insights into the diet of this endangered predator and confirms the efficacy of DNA metabarcoding of scat as a noninvasive tool to more broadly define regional biodiversity.","13","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","apex predator | dietary scat analysis | DNA metabarcoding | Neophoca cinerea | next generation sequencing","21100264002","SF009371","Foundation for National Parks and Wildlife","1","TRUE","748","7","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

During mixed-template amplification of barcoding regions, chimera formation is frequent and well documented. However, profiling of fungal communities typically uses the more variable rDNA region ITS. Due to a larger research community, tools for chimera detection have been developed mainly for the 16S/18S markers. However, these tools are widely applied to the ITS region without verification of their performance. We examined the rate of chimera formation during amplification and 454 sequencing of the ITS2 region from fungal mock communities of different complexities. We evaluated the chimera detecting ability of two common chimera-checking algorithms: perseus and uchime. Large proportions of the chimeras reported were false positives. No false negatives were found in the data set. Verified chimeras accounted for only 0.2% of the total ITS2 reads, which is considerably less than what is typically reported in 16S and 18S metabarcoding analyses. Verified chimeric ‘parent sequences’ had significantly higher per cent identity to one another than to random members of the mock communities. Community complexity increased the rate of chimera formation. GC content was higher around the verified chimeric break points, potentially facilitating chimera formation through base pair mismatching in the neighbouring regions of high similarity in the chimeric region. We conclude that the hypervariable nature of the ITS region seems to buffer the rate of chimera formation in comparison with other, less variable barcoding regions, due to shorter regions of high sequence similarity.","12","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","chimeric sequences | DNA metabarcoding | microbial ecology | PCR bias | uchime","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","749","17","4","27775220",NA,NA,NA,2017

Investigating the relationship between body condition, age, sex, diet quality and diet composition is therefore relevant to increase understanding of herbivores' ecosystem function and to inform management. In this study, we focused on red deer, Cervus elaphus, in a fenced nature reserve in Denmark, where the deer are managed as ecosystem engineers to contribute to biodiversity conservation. We measured body mass and body size of 91 culled red deer, and determined diet composition using DNA metabarcoding and diet quality using fecal nitrogen on 246 fecal samples. We found that body condition was predicted by age and diet composition, but not diet quality. We also found that individuals of different body condition had different diets, i.e., the fecal samples of red deer in poorer body condition contained significantly more Ericaceae sequences than red deer in good body condition. This may imply that certain functions of red deer in ecosystems, such as regeneration of heather by grazing, may depend on variation in body condition within the population.

One of the fundamental patterns in macroecology is the increase in the number of observed taxa with size of sampled area. For microbes, the shape of this relationship remains less clear. The current study assessed the diversity of aquatic fungi, by the traditional approach based on conidial morphology (captures reproducing aquatic hyphomycetes) and next generation sequencing (NGS; captures other fungi as well), on graded sizes of alder leaves (0.6 to 13.6 cm 2 ). Leaves were submerged in two streams in geographically distant locations: the Oliveira Stream in Portugal and the Boss Brook in Canada. Decay rates of alder leaves and fungal sporulation rates did not differ between streams. Fungal biomass was higher in Boss Brook than in Oliveira Stream, and in both streams almost 100% of the reads belonged to active fungal taxa. In general, larger leaf areas tended to harbour more fungi, but these findings were not consistent between techniques. Morphospecies-based diversity increased with leaf area in Boss Brook, but not in Oliveira Stream; metabarcoding data showed an opposite trend. The higher resolution of metabarcoding resulted in steeper taxa-accumulation curves than morphospecies-based assessments (fungal conidia morphology). Fungal communities assessed by metabarcoding were spatially structured by leaf area in both streams. Metabarcoding promises greater resolution to assess biodiversity patterns in aquatic fungi and may be more accurate for assessing taxa-area relationships and local to global diversity ratios.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","753","12","7","28719634","e0181545",NA,NA,2017

In most genera, richness peaked in the mid-elevation montane forest zone, with the exception of tomentelloid fungi, which showed monotonal decrease in richness with increasing altitude. Richness in lower-mid- and mid-elevations was significantly greater than predicted under the mid-domain effect model.

Climate change may alter mycorrhizal communities, which impact ecosystem characteristics such as carbon sequestration processes. These impacts occur at a greater magnitude in Arctic ecosystems, where the climate is warming faster than in lower latitudes. Cassiope tetragona (L.) D. Don is an Arctic plant species in the Ericaceae family with a circumpolar range. C. tetragona has been reported to form ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) as well as ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbioses. In this study, the fungal taxa present within roots of C. tetragona plants collected from Svalbard were investigated using DNA metabarcoding. In light of ongoing climate change in the Arctic, the effects of artificial warming by open-top chambers (OTCs) on the fungal root community of C. tetragona were evaluated. We detected only a weak effect of warming by OTCs on the root-associated fungal communities that was masked by the spatial variation between sampling sites. The root fungal community of C. tetragona was dominated by fungal groups in the Basidiomycota traditionally classified as either saprotrophic or ECM symbionts, including the orders Sebacinales and Agaricales and the genera Clavaria, Cortinarius, and Mycena. Only a minor proportion of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) could be annotated as ErM-forming fungi. This indicates that C. tetragona may be forming mycorrhizal symbioses with typically ECM-forming fungi, although no characteristic ECM root tips were observed. Previous studies have indicated that some saprophytic fungi may also be involved in biotrophic associations, but whether the saprotrophic fungi in the roots of C. tetragona are involved in biotrophic associations remains unclear. The need for more experimental and microscopy-based studies to reveal the nature of the fungal associations in C. tetragona roots is emphasized.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Arctic | Cassiope tetragona | Climate change | Ectomycorrhiza | Ericoid mycorrhiza | High-throughput sequencing | Open-top chambers | OTCs | Root-associated fungi | Svalbard","19836","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","757","27","5","28349216",NA,NA,NA,2017

Top predator populations, once intensively hunted, are rebounding in size and geographic distribution. The cessation of sealing along coastal Australia and subsequent recovery of Australian Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus and long-nosed A. forsteri fur seals represents a unique opportunity to investigate trophic linkages at a frontier of predator recolonisation. We characterised the diets of both species across 2 locations of recolonisation, one site an established breeding colony, and the other, a new but permanent haul-out site. Using DNA metabarcoding, high taxonomic resolution data on diets was used to inform ecological trait-based analyses across time and location. Australian and long-nosed fur seals consumed 76 and 73 prey taxa, respectively, a prey diversity greater than previously reported. We found unexpected overlap of prey functional traits in the diets of both seal species at the haul-out site, where we observed strong trophic linkages with coastal ecosystems due to the prevalence of benthic, demersal and reefassociated prey. The diets of both seal species at the breeding colony were consistent with for -Aging patterns observed in the centre of their geographic range regarding diet partitioning between predator species and seasonal trends typically observed. The unexpected differences between sites in this region and the convergence of both predators' effective ecological roles at the range-edge haul-out site correlate with known differences in seal population densities and demographics at these and other newly recolonised locations. This study provides a baseline for the diets and trophic interactions for recovering fur seal populations and from which to understand the evolving ecology of predator recolonisation.","9","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","Arctocephalus forsteri | Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus | DNA metabarcoding | Fur seals | Otariid | Predator-prey interactions | Recolonisation | Trophic ecology","12169","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","760","573",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Agricultural productivity relies on a wide range of ecosystem services provided by the soil biota. Plowing is a fundamental component of conventional farming, but long-term detrimental effects such as soil erosion and loss of soil organic matter have been recognized. Moving towards more sustainable management practices such as reduced tillage or crop residue retention can reduce these detrimental effects, but will also influence structure and function of the soil microbiota with direct consequences for the associated ecosystem services. Although there is increasing evidence that different tillage regimes alter the soil microbiome, we have a limited understanding of the temporal dynamics of these effects. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing of bacterial and fungal ribosomal markers to explore changes in soil microbial community structure under two contrasting tillage regimes (conventional and reduced tillage) either with or without crop residue retention. Soil samples were collected over the growing season of two crops (Vicia faba and Triticum aestivum) below the seedbed (15-20 cm). Tillage, crop and growing stage were significant determinants of microbial community structure, but the impact of tillage showed only moderate temporal dependency. Whereas the tillage effect on soil bacteria showed some temporal dependency and became less strong at later growing stages, the tillage effect on soil fungi was more consistent over time. Crop residue retention had only a minor influence on the community. Six years after the conversion from conventional to reduced tillage, soil moisture contents and nutrient levels were significantly lower under reduced than under conventional tillage. These changes in edaphic properties were related to specific shifts in microbial community structure. Notably, bacterial groups featuring copiotrophic lifestyles or potentially carrying the ability to degrade more recalcitrant compounds were favored under conventional tillage, whereas taxa featuring more oligotrophic lifestyles were more abundant under reduced tillage. Our study found that, under the specific edaphic and climatic context of central Belgium, different tillage regimes created different ecological niches that select for different microbial lifestyles with potential consequences for the ecosystem services provided to the plants and their environment.","11","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Conventional tillage | Crop residue management | Cropping season | Metabarcoding | Microbial diversity | Reduced tillage","21100226442","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","761","8","JUN",NA,"1127",NA,NA,2017

Deep-sea sediments constitute a unique archive of ocean change, fueled by a permanent rain of mineral and organic remains from the surface ocean. Until now, paleo-ecological analyses of this archive have been mostly based on information from taxa leaving fossils. In theory, environmental DNA (eDNA) in the sediment has the potential to provide information on non-fossilized taxa, allowing more comprehensive interpretations of the fossil record. Yet, the process controlling the transport and deposition of eDNA onto the sediment and the extent to which it preserves the features of past oceanic biota remains unknown. Planktonic foraminifera are the ideal taxa to allow an assessment of the eDNA signal modification during deposition because their fossils are well preserved in the sediment and their morphological taxonomy is documented by DNA barcodes. Specifically, we re-analyze foraminiferal-specific metabarcodes from 31 deep-sea sediment samples, which were shown to contain a small fraction of sequences from planktonic foraminifera. We confirm that the largest portion of the metabarcode originates from benthic bottom-dwelling foraminifera, representing the in situ community, but a small portion (< 10 %) of the metabarcodes can be unambiguously assigned to planktonic taxa. These organisms live exclusively in the surface ocean and the recovered barcodes thus represent an allochthonous component deposited with the rain of organic remains from the surface ocean. We take advantage of the planktonic foraminifera portion of the metabarcodes to establish to what extent the structure of the surface ocean biota is preserved in sedimentary eDNA. We show that planktonic foraminifera DNA is preserved in a range of marine sediment types, the composition of the recovered eDNA metabarcode is replicable and that both the similarity structure and the diversity pattern are preserved. Our results suggest that sedimentary eDNA could preserve the ecological structure of the entire pelagic community, including non-fossilized taxa, thus opening new avenues for paleoceanographic and paleoecological studies.","1","Journal","ar","Article","100","10",NA,"130037","313003A-159709","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung","1","TRUE","762","14","11",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Previous studies have shown that more highly resolved networks can be constructed by studying pollen loads taken from bees, relative to field observations. DNA metabarcoding potentially allows for faster and finer-scale taxonomic resolution of pollen compared to traditional approaches (e.g., light microscopy), but has not been applied to pollination networks. • Methods: We sampled pollen from 38 bee species collected in Florida from sites differing in forest management. We isolated DNA from pollen mixtures and sequenced rbcL and ITS2 gene regions from all mixtures in a single run on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We identified species from sequence data using comprehensive rbcL and ITS2 databases. • Results: We successfully built a proof-of-concept quantitative pollination network using pollen metabarcoding. • Discussion: Our work underscores that pollen metabarcoding is not quantitative but that quantitative networks can be constructed based on the number of interacting individuals. Due to the frequency of contamination and false positive reads, isolation and PCR negative controls should be used in every reaction. DNA metabarcoding has advantages in efficiency and resolution over microscopic identification of pollen, and we expect that it will have broad utility for future studies of plant-pollinator interactions.","19","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","DNA metabarcoding | ITS | palynology | plant-pollinator interactions | pollination networks | rbcL","21100403506","W911NF-13-1-0100","U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory","1","TRUE","763","5","6",NA,"1600124",NA,NA,2017

Gammarus fossarum is a common freshwater gammarid in many parts of mainland Europe, but was previously considered absent from the UK. Gammarus fossarum was detected in a number of UK rivers following DNA metabarcoding of a mini-barcode region of the COI gene in macroinvertebrate kick samples, and environmental DNA (eDNA) from water and sediment samples. Subsequent morphological analysis and standard DNA barcoding showed that the species could be reliably identified and separated from Gammarus pulex (Linnaeus, 1758), the most dominant and widespread native freshwater gammarid in the UK. Our data demonstrate extensive geographical coverage of G. fossarum in the UK, spanning distant river catchments. At present there is no data to confirm the likely origin of G. fossarum’s introduction. Subsequent re-examination of historic archive material shows the species to have been present in the UK since at least 1964.

Human impact on marine benthic communities has traditionally been assessed using visible morphological traits and has focused on the macrobenthos, whereas the ecologically important organisms of the meio- and microbenthos have received less attention. DNA metabarcoding offers an alternative to this approach and enables a larger fraction of the biodiversity in marine sediments to be monitored in a cost-efficient manner. Although this methodology remains poorly standardised and challenged by biases inherent to rRNA copy number variation, DNA extraction, PCR, and limitations related to taxonomic identification, it has been shown to be semi-quantitative and useful for comparing taxon abundances between samples. Here, we evaluate the effect of replicating genomic DNA extraction in order to counteract small scale spatial heterogeneity and improve diversity and community structure estimates in metabarcoding-based monitoring. For this purpose, we used ten technical replicates from three different marine sediment samples. The effect of sequence depth was also assessed, and in silico pooling of DNA extraction replicates carried out in order to maintain the number of reads constant. Our analyses demonstrated that both sequencing depth and DNA extraction replicates could improve diversity estimates as well as the ability to separate samples with different characteristics. We could not identify a “sufficient” replicate number or sequence depth, where further improvements had a less significant effect. Based on these results, we consider replication an attractive alternative to directly increasing the amount of sample used for DNA extraction and strongly recommend it for future metabarcoding studies and routine assessments of sediment biodiversity.","10","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"10600153309","190265/S40","Statoil","1","TRUE","765","12","6","28622351","e0179443",NA,NA,2017

The mosquito family (Diptera: Culicidae) constitutes the most medically important group of arthropods because certain species are vectors of human pathogens. In some parts of the world, the diversity is so high that the accurate delimitation and/or identification of species is challenging. A DNA-based identification system for all animals has been proposed, the socalled DNA barcoding approach. In this study, our objectives were (i) to establish DNA barcode libraries for the mosquitoes of French Guiana based on the COI and the 16S markers, (ii) to compare distance-based and tree-based methods of species delimitation to traditional taxonomy, and (iii) to evaluate the accuracy of each marker in identifying specimens. A total of 266 specimens belonging to 75 morphologically identified species or morphospecies were analyzed allowing us to delimit 86 DNA clusters with only 21 of them already present in the BOLD database. We thus provide a substantial contribution to the global mosquito barcoding initiative. Our results confirm that DNA barcodes can be successfully used to delimit and identify mosquito species with only a few cases where the marker could not distinguish closely related species. Our results also validate the presence of new species identified based on morphology, plus potential cases of cryptic species. We found that both COI and 16S markers performed very well, with successful identifications at the species level of up to 98% for COI and 97% for 16S when compared to traditional taxonomy. This shows great potential for the use of metabarcoding for vector monitoring and eco-epidemiological studies.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","766","12","6","28575090","e0176993",NA,NA,2017

However, recent research has uncovered many examples of closely related herbivores using the same host plant(s), suggesting that partitioning of host plants is not the only mechanism generating diversity. Herbivores sharing hosts may utilize different parts of the same plant, but such resource partitioning is often not apparent; hence, the factors that allow closely related herbivores to coexist are still largely undetermined. We examined whether partitioning of phenology or natural enemies may explain the coexistence of leaf cone moths (Caloptilia; Gracillariidae) associated with maples (Acer; Sapindaceae). Larval activity of 10 sympatric Caloptilia species found on nine maple species was monitored every 2–3 weeks for a total of 13 sampling events, and an exhaustive search for internal parasitoid wasps was conducted using high-throughput sequencing. Blocking primers were used to facilitate the detection of wasp larvae inside moth tissue. We found considerable phenological overlap among Caloptilia species, with two clear peaks in July and September–October. Coexisting Caloptilia species also had largely overlapping parasitoid communities; a total of 13 chalcid and ichneumon wasp species attacked Caloptilia in a nonspecific fashion at an overall parasitism rate of 46.4%. Although coexistence may be facilitated by factors not accounted for in this study, it appears that niche partitioning is not necessary for closely related herbivores to stably coexist on shared hosts. Co-occurrence without resource partitioning may provide an additional axis along which herbivorous insects attain increased species richness.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","closely related species | herbivorous insect | metabarcoding | parasitoid | phenology | species coexistence","20297","15J00601",NA,"0","FALSE","767","26","12","28316099",NA,NA,NA,2017

Coastal marine fish populations are in decline due to overfishing, habitat destruction, climate change and invasive species. Seasonal monitoring is important for detecting temporal changes in the composition of fish communities, but current monitoring is often non-existent or limited to annual or semi-annual surveys. In the present study, we investigate the potential of using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of seawater samples to detect the seasonal changes in a coastal marine fish community. Water sampling and snorkelling visual census were performed over 1 year (from 23rd of August 2013 to 11th of August 2014) at a temperate coastal habitat in Denmark (55°45'39<U+2033>N, 12°35'59<U+2033>E) and compared to long-term data collected over a 7-year period. We used Illumina sequencing of PCR products to demonstrate that seawater eDNA showed compositional changes in accordance with seasonal changes in the fish community. The vast majority of fish diversity observed in the study area by snorkelling was recovered from sequencing, although the overlap between methods varied widely among sampling events. In total, 24 taxa were detected by both methods, while five taxa were only detected using eDNA and three taxa were only detected by snorkelling. A limitation of the applied primers was the lack of resolution to species level in a few diverse families, and varying sequencing depth between samples represents a potential bias. However, our study demonstrates the utility of eDNA for recovering seasonal variation in marine fish communities, knowledge of which is essential for standardised long-term monitoring of marine biodiversity.","10","Journal","ar","Article","100","9",NA,"12165","DNRF94","Danmarks Grundforskningsfond","0","FALSE","768","164","6",NA,"128",NA,NA,2017

All mats were highly diverse, including members of virtually all known high-rank eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa but also many novel lineages. Bacterial candidate divisions accounted for almost 50% of sequences in deeper mats, while Archaea represented up to 40% of sequences in some mat layers. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed six novel deeply divergent archaeal groups, along abundant and diverse Pacearchaeota and Woesearchaeota. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that local environmental conditions strongly influenced community composition. Co-occurrence network structure was markedly different between surface mats located in the oxygenated zone and mats located in transition and anoxic water layers. We identified potential biotic interactions between various high- and low-rank taxa. Notably, a strong positive correlation was observed between Lokiarchaeota and the poorly known candidate bacterial division TA06.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"19683","322669","European Research Council","0","FALSE","770","19","6","28489281",NA,NA,NA,2017

Camera-trap surveys have shown that natural saltlicks can be used to determine mammalian fauna, especially medium to large endangered species in tropical forests; establishment of camera traps, however, is time and effort intensive. Furthermore, the photographic range and detectable size of species are often restricted. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a powerful approach that might provide a better way to study terrestrial animals in tropical forests. In this study, we examined whether eDNA from natural saltlicks comprehensively represented species composition in a Bornean tropical forest. We collected 100–150-mL water samples from natural saltlicks in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We constructed amplicon libraries for MiSeq sequencing using eDNA extracted from the water samples. Six endangered species were detected using this method, including Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), Bornean banteng (Bos javanicus lowi), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) and bearded pig (Sus barbatus). However, most small and minor species were not detected, with low sequence identity (80–96%). Therefore, we propose that more species of tropical forest mammals should have their sequences deposited in DNA databases.

Our goals were to compare (1) diversity and (2) community composition of protists in BW among and between port systems. Location: Chesapeake Bay in Virginia (Port of Hampton Roads), Galveston Bay in Texas (Ports of Texas City, Houston and Bayport) and Prince William Sound in Alaska (Port of Valdez). Methods: We collected 61 BW samples from 39 vessels from May to August 2013. We conducted amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the hypervariable V4 domain of the small subunit (SSU) gene of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) complex to identify protistan taxa. Results: We detected 8,561 OTUs from protistan taxa, including 35 taxonomic groups. We found high protistan diversity in the BW entering all three port systems, with the dominant taxa belonging to the Alveolata, Rhizaria and Stramenopiles. Thirty-eight taxa were found in high relative abundance (>10,000 sequences), and some were recovered from multiple samples within and across ports, indicating both a high relative abundance and frequency of introduction events. The composition of the protistan communities entering each of the port systems appeared to vary depending on BW source, with those entering Valdez being consistently more similar to each other than those entering other port systems. Main conclusions: This study is the most comprehensive assessment of protistan diversity in BW and has important implications for microbial biogeography and invasions. Ships’ BW is importing distinct and diverse protistan communities to U.S. coasts with high propagule pressure for some taxa, creating opportunity for invasion by novel taxa. Further, our results demonstrate the broad-scale movement of marine protists that has occurred through BW, highlighting a discrepancy between the large magnitude of introductions and limited number of known microbial invasions.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","introduction | metabarcode | non-indigenous | non-native | propagule pressure | protistan richness","14551","undefined","Smithsonian Institution","1","TRUE","772","23","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Monitoring biodiversity recovery is essential to measure success; however, most projects remain insufficiently monitored. Current field-based methods are hard to standardize and are limited in their ability to assess important components of ecosystems, such as bacteria. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of environmental DNA (metabarcoding of eDNA) has been proposed as a cost-effective, scalable and uniform ecological monitoring solution, but its application in restoration remains largely untested. Here we show that metabarcoding of soil eDNA is effective at demonstrating the return of the native bacterial community in an old field following native plant revegetation. Bacterial composition shifted significantly after 8 years of revegetation, where younger sites were more similar to cleared sites and older sites were more similar to remnant stands. Revegetation of the native plant community strongly impacted on the belowground bacterial community, despite the revegetated sites having a long and dramatically altered land-use history (i.e. >100 years grazing). We demonstrate that metabarcoding of eDNA provides an effective way of monitoring changes in bacterial communities that would otherwise go unchecked with conventional monitoring of restoration projects.

The emergence of DNA analyses of lake sediments has opened up many new areas of inquiry, including the study of taxa that were traditionally not considered in paleolimnology because they do not leave distinct morphological fossils. Here, we discuss the potential and challenges associated with the study of DNA in paleolimnology to address critical research questions in lacustrine ecology. We examine some recent applications by highlighting studies that have quantified centennial to millennial-scale dynamics, and that considered a diversity of planktonic groups, including bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton. We also summarize the main methodological precautions to be taken into account for implementing these types of DNA analyses. Based on our review of the literature focused on the analysis of DNA preserved in lake sediments, the emerging topics we have identified include: (1) the spread, establishment and effect of invasive species, (2) past fish population dynamics, (3) interactions within lacustrine communities, identified through network analyses, (4) potential application of metabarcoding for transfer functions.

Many bacteria and fungi in the plant rhizosphere and endosphere are beneficial to plant nutrient acquisition, health, and growth. Although playing essential roles in ecosystem functioning, our knowledge about the effects of multiple cropping regimes on the plant microbiome and their interactions is still limited. Here, we designed a pot experiment simulating different cropping regimes. For this purpose, wheat and faba bean plants were grown under controlled greenhouse conditions in monocultures and in two intercropping regimes: row and mixed intercropping. Bacterial and fungal communities in bulk and rhizosphere soils as well as in the roots and aerial plant parts were analyzed using large-scale metabarcoding. We detected differences in microbial richness and diversity between the cropping regimes. Generally, observed effects were attributed to differences between mixed and row intercropping or mixed intercropping and monoculture. Bacterial and fungal diversity were significantly higher in bulk soil samples of wheat and faba bean grown in mixed compared to row intercropping. Moreover, microbial communities varied between crop species and plant compartments resulting in different responses of these communities toward cropping regimes. Leaf endophytes were not affected by cropping regime but bacterial and fungal community structures in bulk and rhizosphere soil as well as fungal community structures in roots. We further recorded highly complex changes in microbial interactions. The number of negative inter-domain correlations between fungi and bacteria decreased in bulk and rhizosphere soil in intercropping regimes compared to monocultures due to beneficial effects. In addition, we observed plant species-dependent differences indicating that intra- and interspecific competition between plants had different effects on the plant species and thus on their associated microbial communities. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating microbial communities in different plant compartments with respect to multiple cropping regimes using large-scale metabarcoding. Although a simple design simulating different cropping regimes was used, obtained results contribute to the understanding how cropping regimes affect bacterial and fungal communities and their interactions in different plant compartments. Nonetheless, we need field experiments to properly quantify observed effects in natural ecosystems.","9","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Co-occurrence networks | Indicator species | Microbial diversity | Microbial interactions | Multiple cropping vs. monoculture","21100226442","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","777","8","MAY",NA,"902",NA,NA,2017

Many ocean policies mandate integrated, ecosystem-based approaches to marine monitoring, driving a global need for efficient, low-cost bioindicators of marine ecological quality. Most traditional methods to assess biological quality rely on specialized expertise to provide visual identification of a limited set of specific taxonomic groups, a time-consuming process that can provide a narrow view of ecological status. In addition, microbial assemblages drive food webs but are not amenable to visual inspection and thus are largely excluded from detailed inventory. Molecular-based assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem function offer advantages over traditional methods and are increasingly being generated for a suite of taxa using a ""microbes to mammals"" or ""barcodes to biomes"" approach. Progress in these efforts coupled with continued improvements in high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics pave the way for sequence data to be employed in formal integrated ecosystem evaluation, including food web assessments, as called for in the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive. DNA sequencing of bioindicators, both traditional (e.g., benthic macroinvertebrates, ichthyoplankton) and emerging (e.g., microbial assemblages, fish via eDNA), promises to improve assessment of marine biological quality by increasing the breadth, depth, and throughput of information and by reducing costs and reliance on specialized taxonomic expertise.","11","Journal","re","Review","100","7","Biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) | eDNA | Good ecological status (GES) | Marine biological quality element (BQE) | Metabarcoding | Metagenetics | Metagenomics","21100790929","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","778","4","MAY",NA,"107",NA,NA,2017

Recent research coupling metabarcoding and environmental DNA (eDNA) demonstrate that these methods can serve as important tools for surveying biodiversity, while significantly decreasing the time, expense and resources spent on traditional survey methods. The literature emphasizes the importance of genetic marker development, as the markers dictate the applicability, sensitivity and resolution ability of an eDNA assay. The present study developed two metabarcoding eDNA assays using the mtDNA 16S RNA gene with Illumina MiSeq platform to detect invertebrate fauna in the Laurentian Great Lakes and surrounding waterways, with a focus for use on invasive bivalve and gastropod species monitoring. We employed careful primer design and in vitro testing with mock communities to assess ability of the markers to amplify and sequence targeted species DNA, while retaining rank abundance information. In our mock communities, read abundances reflected the initial input abundance, with regressions having significant slopes (p<0.05) and high coefficients of determination (R2) for all comparisons. Tests on field environmental samples revealed similar ability of our markers to measure relative abundance. Due to the limited reference sequence data available for these invertebrate species, care must be taken when analyzing results and identifying sequence reads to species level. These markers extend eDNA meta-barcoding research for molluscs and appear relevant to other invertebrate taxa, such as rotifers and bryozoans. Furthermore, the sphaeriid mussel assay is group-specific, exclusively amplifying bivalves in the Sphaeridae family and providing species-level identification. Our assays provide useful tools for managers and conservation scientists, facilitating early detection of invasive species as well as improving resolution of mollusc diversity.","15","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","779","12","5","28542313","e0177643",NA,NA,2017

Thus, the development of optimized primers for communities or taxa under study in a certain geographic region and/or ecosystems is of critical importance. However, no tool for obtaining and processing of reference sequence data in bulk that can serve as a backbone for primer design is currently available. We developed the r package PrimerMiner, which batch downloads DNA barcode gene sequences from BOLD and NCBI data bases for specified target taxonomic groups and then applies sequence clustering into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to reduce biases introduced by the different number of available sequences per species. Additionally, PrimerMiner offers functionalities to evaluate primers in silico, which are in our opinion more realistic than the strategy employed in another available software for that purpose, ecoPCR. We used PrimerMiner to download cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences for 15 important freshwater invertebrate groups, relevant for ecosystem assessment. By processing COI markers from both data bases, we were able to increase the amount of reference data 249-fold on average, compared to using complete mitochondrial genomes alone. Furthermore, we visualized the generated OTU sequence alignments and describe how to evaluate primers in silico using PrimerMiner. With PrimerMiner, we provide a useful tool to obtain relevant sequence data for targeted primer development and evaluation.

The transition from benthos to plankton requires multiple adaptations, yet so far it remains unclear how these are acquired in the course of the transition. To investigate this process, we analyzed the genetic diversity and distribution patterns of a group of foraminifera of the genus Bolivina with a tychopelagic mode of life (same species occurring both in benthos and plankton). We assembled a global sequence data set for this group from single-cell DNA extractions and occurrences in metabarcodes from pelagic environmental samples. The pelagic sequences all cluster within a single monophyletic clade within Bolivina. This clade harbors three distinct genetic lineages, which are associated with incipient morphological differentiation. All lineages occur in the plankton and benthos, but only one lineage exhibits no limit to offshore dispersal and has been shown to grow in the plankton. These observations indicate that the emergence of buoyancy regulation within the clade preceded the evolution of pelagic feeding and that the evolution of both traits was not channeled into a full transition into the plankton. We infer that in foraminifera, colonization of the planktonic niche may occur by sequential cooptation of independently acquired traits, with holoplanktonic species being recruited from tychopelagic ancestors.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","bentho-pelagic transition | foraminifera | tychopelagic","29635","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","784","39","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Journal of Ecology © 2017 British Ecological Society Fungi play critical roles in ecosystem processes and interact with plant communities in mutualistic, pathogenic, and commensal ways. Fungal communities are thought to depend on both associated tree communities and soil properties. However, the relative importance of the biotic and abiotic drivers of soil fungal community structure and diversity in lowland tropical forests remains poorly understood. We examined the community structure of trees and fungi at different levels of phosphorus (0·17–16·3 mg kg-1) in moist tropical forests in Panama. We predicted that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal composition would be more strongly associated with soil properties than with local tree communities while the composition of other fungal clades would be more strongly correlated with local tree communities than soil properties. We also predicted that fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness would be negatively correlated with soil fertility and positively correlated with tree species diversity within and among forests. We characterized soil chemistry, fine root biomass, and sequenced the ITS1 barcode region to describe fungal community composition from 70 soil cores across three 1-ha tropical rainforest sites in Panama. The sites vary in soil chemistry, including P, and in tree species community composition, but experience similar annual rainfall. AM fungal community composition was partially correlated with soil chemistry (r = 0·32, P = 0·001), but not with local tree communities, while non-AM fungal communities were nearly equally correlated with soil chemistry (Partial Mantel test, r = 0·38, P = 0·001) as with tree communities (r = 0·36, P = 0·001). Linear models showed that AM OTU richness was not explained by any independent variable. For non-AM fungi, phosphorus, pH, and soil moisture better predicted OTU richness across all cores than other biotic and abiotic factors. Synthesis. Our results show that AM fungal structure is driven primarily by soil chemistry. For non-AM fungi, soil properties and the local tree community can play a joint role in structuring communities. Furthermore, we found that more diverse local tree communities did not harbour more fungal species. Our results suggest that soil properties act as an environmental filter for both trees and fungi, setting the stage for interactions between the two.","18","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","ITS1 | metabarcoding | microbial ecology | mycorrhizal fungi | Panama | plant–soil (below-ground) interactions | soil phosphorus","29602","DEB 1542681","National Science Foundation","1","TRUE","787","105","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Summary: Recent advances in sequencing technologies now permit the analyses of plant DNA from fossil samples (ancient plant DNA, plant aDNA), and thus enable the molecular reconstruction of palaeofloras. Hitherto, ancient frozen soils have proved excellent in preserving DNA molecules, and have thus been the most commonly used source of plant aDNA. However, DNA from soil mainly represents taxa growing a few metres from the sampling point. Lakes have larger catchment areas and recent studies have suggested that plant aDNA from lake sediments is a more powerful tool for palaeofloristic reconstruction. Furthermore, lakes can be found globally in nearly all environments, and are therefore not limited to perennially frozen areas. Here, we review the latest approaches and methods for the study of plant aDNA from lake sediments and discuss the progress made up to the present. We argue that aDNA analyses add new and additional perspectives for the study of ancient plant populations and, in time, will provide higher taxonomic resolution and more precise estimation of abundance. Despite this, key questions and challenges remain for such plant aDNA studies. Finally, we provide guidelines on technical issues, including lake selection, and we suggest directions for future research on plant aDNA studies in lake sediments.","30","Journal","re","Review","100","7","ancient plant DNA (aDNA) | bioinformatics | environmental DNA (eDNA) | high-throughput DNA sequencing | lake sediments | metabarcoding | pollen | shotgun sequencing | taphonomy","19908","213692/F20","Vetenskapsrådet","1","TRUE","788","214","3","28370025",NA,NA,NA,2017

High-throughput DNA metabarcoding has gained recognition as a potentially powerful tool for biomonitoring, including early detection of aquatic invasive species (AIS). DNA based techniques are advancing, but our understanding of the limits to detection for metabarcoding complex samples is inadequate. For detecting AIS at an early stage of invasion when the species is rare, accuracy at low detection limits is key. To evaluate the utility of metabarcoding in future fish community monitoring programs, we conducted several experiments to determine the sensitivity and accuracy of routine metabarcoding methods. Experimental mixes used larval fish tissue from multiple ""common"" species spiked with varying proportions of tissue from an additional ""rare"" species. Pyrosequencing of genetic marker, COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) and subsequent sequence data analysis provided experimental evidence of low-level detection of the target ""rare"" species at biomass percentages as low as 0.02% of total sample biomass. Limits to detection varied interspecifically and were susceptible to amplification bias. Moreover, results showed some data processing methods can skew sequence-based biodiversity measurements from corresponding relative biomass abundances and increase false absences. We suggest caution in interpreting presence/absence and relative abundance in larval fish assemblages until metabarcoding methods are optimized for accuracy and precision.","10","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"21100200805","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","789","7",NA,NA,"46393",NA,"srep46393",2017

A central challenge in the present era of biodiversity loss is to assess and manage human impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Macroinvertebrates are an important group for such bioassessments as many taxa show specific responses to environmental conditions. However, generating accurate macroinvertebrate inventories based on primarily larval morphology is difficult and error-prone. Here, DNA metabarcoding provides new opportunities. Its potential to accurately identify invertebrates in bulk samples to the species level has been demonstrated in several case studies. However, DNA based identification is often limited by primer bias, potentially leading to taxa in the sample remaining undetected. Thus, the success of DNA metabarcoding as an emerging technique for bioassessment critically relies on carefully evaluated primers. We used the R package PrimerMiner to obtain and process cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequence data for the 15 globally most relevant freshwater invertebrate groups for stream assessment. Using these sequence alignments, we developed four primer combinations optimized for freshwater macroinvertebrates. All primers were evaluated by sequencing 10 mock community samples, each consisting of 52 freshwater invertebrate taxa. Additionally, popular metabarcoding primers from the literature and the developed primers were tested in silico against these 15 relevant invertebrate groups. The developed primers varied in amplification efficiency and the number of detected taxa, yet, all detected more taxa than standard ""Folmer"" barcoding primers. Two new primer combinations showed even more consistent amplification than a previously tested ribosomal marker (16S) and detected all 42 insect taxa present in the mock community samples. In silico evaluation revealed critical design flaws in some commonly used primers from the literature. We demonstrate a reliable strategy to develop optimized primers using the tool PrimerMiner. The developed primers detected almost all taxa present in the mock samples, and we argue that high base degeneracy is necessary to decrease primer bias as confirmed by experimental results and in silico primer evaluation. We further demonstrate that some primers currently used in metabarcoding studies may not be suitable for amplification of freshwater macroinvertebrates. Therefore, careful primer evaluation and more region/ecosystem specific primers are needed before DNA metabarcoding can be used for routine bioassessment of freshwater ecosystems.","35","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","DNA barcoding | Ecosystem assessment | In silico PCR | Invertebrates | Primer bias | Primer development | Primer evaluation","21100826280","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","790","5","APR",NA,"11",NA,NA,2017

However, such increased capability could also lead to analytical challenges if the methods used to examine these communities across local and global scales are not standardized. Here we compare and assess the underlying biases of four ARMS field processing methods, preservation media, and current bioinformatic pipelines in evaluating diversity from cytochrome c oxidase I metabarcoding data. Illustrating the ability of ARMS-based metabarcoding to capture a wide spectrum of biodiversity, 3,372 OTUs and twenty-eight phyla, including 17 of 33 marine metazoan phyla, were detected from 3 ARMS (2.607 m2 area) collected on coral reefs in Mo'orea, French Polynesia. Significant differences were found between processing and preservation methods, demonstrating the need to standardize methods for biodiversity comparisons. We recommend the use of a standardized protocol (NOAA method) combined with DMSO preservation of tissues for sessile macroorganisms because it gave a more accurate representation of the underlying communities, is cost effective and removes chemical restrictions associated with sample transportation. We found that sequences identified at 97% similarity increased more than 7-fold (5.1% to 38.6%) using a geographically local barcode inventory, highlighting the importance of local species inventories. Phylogenetic approaches that assign higher taxonomic ranks accrued phylum identification errors (9.7%) due to sparse taxonomic coverage of the understudied cryptic coral reef community in public databases. However, a 85% sequence identity cut-off provided more accurate results (0.7% errors) and enabled phylum level identifications of 86.3% of the sequence reads.

Methods in Ecology and Evolution © 2017 British Ecological Society A crucial step in the use of DNA markers for biodiversity surveys is the assignment of Linnaean taxonomies (species, genus, etc.) to sequence reads. This allows the use of all the information known based on the taxonomic names. Taxonomic placement of DNA barcoding sequences is inherently probabilistic because DNA sequences contain errors, because there is natural variation among sequences within a species, and because reference data bases are incomplete and can have false annotations. However, most existing bioinformatics methods for taxonomic placement either exclude uncertainty, or quantify it using metrics other than probability. In this paper we evaluate the performance of the recently proposed probabilistic taxonomic placement method PROTAX by applying it to both annotated reference sequence data as well as to unknown environmental data. Our four case studies include contrasting taxonomic groups (fungi, bacteria, mammals and insects), variation in the length and quality of the barcoding sequences (from individually Sanger-sequenced sequences to short Illumina reads), variation in the structures and sizes of the taxonomies (800–130 000 species) and variation in the completeness of the reference data bases (representing 15–100% of known species). Our results demonstrate that PROTAX yields essentially unbiased probabilities of taxonomic placement, which means its quantification of species identification uncertainty is reliable. As expected, the accuracy of taxonomic placement increases with increasing coverage of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases, and with increasing ratio of genetic variation among taxonomic levels over within taxonomic levels. We conclude that reliable species-level identification from environmental samples is still challenging and that neglecting identification uncertainty can lead to spurious inference. A key aim for future research is the completion of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases and making these two types of data compatible.","17","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","DNA barcoding | DNA metabarcoding | molecular species identification | multinomial regression | statistical model | taxonomic assignment | taxonomic placement","21100217611","2012FY110800","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China","1","TRUE","795","8","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Satellite telemetry of 23 birds resulted in 6026 location fixes accurate to within 500 m, and combined with extensive field observations and DNA faecal metabarcoding resulted in a more detailed understanding of how this species survives in an urbanized landscape. We identified 168 night roosts, 75% of which were previously unknown, which will contribute towards a more accurate population size estimate based on annual counts of roosting birds. We also determined the scale of daily movements (morning 5.4 ± 3.4 km from roost, afternoon 5.5 ± 3.3 km to roost; maximum distance between consecutive roosts 69.7 km) and the size of foraging areas around roosts (range 17–276 km2), and identified dependence on a variety of native and exotic food sources. Field observations identified 11 food-plant families, but combined with DNA faecal metabarcoding this was extended to 21 food-plant families.

The occurrence of interaction between insects and fungi is interesting from an ecological point of view, particularly when these interactions involve insect pests and plant pathogens within an agroecosystem. In this study, we aimed to perform an accurate analysis on the fungal microbiota associated to Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) through a metabarcoding approach based on 454 pyrosequencing.

Further, the demonstrated adequacy of pollen DNA barcoding from historical records offers opportunities to observe the effects of pollinator loss over longer timescales, and phylogenetic approaches can elucidate the historical rates of extinction of specialist lineages.

Citrus greasy spot (CGS) is a disease of citrus with worldwide distribution and recent surveys have revealed a high level of incidence and severity of symptoms of the disease in Sicily, southern Italy. Although Mycosphaerella citri (anamorph Zasmidium citri-griseum) and other related species are generally considered as causal agents, the etiology of CGS is still unclear. Here, we report the use of an amplicon metagenomic approach to investigate the fungal communities on citrus leaves symptomatic or asymptomatic for CGS from an orchard in Sicily showing typical CGS symptoms. A total of 35,537 high-quality chimeric free reads were obtained and assigned to 176 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), clustered at 99 % similarity threshold. Data revealed a dominating presence of the phylum Ascomycota (92.6 %) over other fungal phyla. No significant difference was observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves according to both alpha and beta diversity analyses.

Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a highly potent neurotoxin targeting voltage gated sodium channels. It is found in numerous phyla, including both marine and terrestrial taxa, however, its origin is a topic of considerable debate. The aim of this study was to investigate the origin of TTX in the Opisthobranch Pleurobranchaea maculata using in situ experimentation. Sixteen individuals sourced from non-toxic populations were transplanted to a habitat with toxic populations. These were kept in mesh net cages either; (1) anchored to the seafloor, or (2) deployed 0.5 m off the benthos. They were fed a non-toxic diet for 8 weeks before being sacrificed, and either the entire organisms or specific organs analysed for TTX via liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Four of the six remaining individuals from cages on the benthos contained TTX (max. 0.79 mg kg -1 ), whilst only two of eight from the suspended cages contained TTX and concentrations were lower (max. 0.43 mg kg -1 ). These were similar to the lowest concentrations (min. 0.4 mg kg -1 ) detected in free-living specimens collected during the experimental period. Among positive individuals the highest concentrations were detected in gonad tissues. These data, in concert with previous studies, suggest an environmental source of TTX for P. maculata, which may be bacterial or dietary in origin. High-Throughput Sequencing (18S ribosomal RNA gene metabarcoding) of foregut contents from toxic and non-toxic individuals was used to investigate their diet. High abundances of Cnidaria and Annelida sequences were identified and these groups should be targeted in future efforts to identify TTX-containing organisms.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Annelida | Cnidaria | High-Throughput Sequencing | Tetrodotoxin","29034","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","803","79","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

It is unknown if similar hyperdiversity patterns are reflected at the microbial scale with unicellular eukaryotes (protists). Here we show, using environmental metabarcoding of soil samples and a phylogeny-aware cleaning step, that protist communities in Neotropical rainforests are hyperdiverse and dominated by the parasitic Apicomplexa, which infect arthropods and other animals. These host-specific parasites potentially contribute to the high animal diversity in the forests by reducing population growth in a density-dependent manner. By contrast, too few operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Oomycota were found to broadly drive high tropical tree diversity in a host-specific manner under the Janzen-Connell model. Extremely high OTU diversity and high heterogeneity between samples within the same forests suggest that protists, not arthropods, are the most diverse eukaryotes in tropical rainforests. Our data show that protists play a large role in tropical terrestrial ecosystems long viewed as being dominated by macroorganisms.","37","Journal","ar","Article","100","22",NA,"21100831440","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","804","1","4","28812652","0091",NA,NA,2017

Herewe report on the characteristic fungal communities generated by these ant species in their domatia. First, we describe behavioural differences between the ant species when presented with a cultured fungal isolate in the laboratory. Second, we use DNA metabarcoding to show that each ant species has a distinctive fungal community in its domatia, and that these communities remain characteristic of the ant species over two Kenyan sampling locations separated by 190 km. Third, we find that DNA extracted from female alates of Tetraponera penzigi and Crematogaster nigriceps contained matches for most of the fungal metabarcodes from those ant species’ domatia, respectively. Fungal hyphae and other debris are also visible in sections of these alates’ infrabuccal pockets. Collectively, our results indicate that domatium fungal communities are associated with the ant species occupying the tree. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of such ant-specific fungal community-level differences on the same myrmecophytic host species. These differences may be shaped by ant behaviour in the domatia, and by ants vectoring fungi when they disperse to establish new colonies. The roles of the fungi with respect to the ants and their host plant remain to be determined.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Fungi | Insects | Metabarcoding | Species interactions | Tetraponera | Vachellia (Acacia) drepanolobium","130030","RFP-12-06","University of Toronto","1","TRUE","805","284","1850","28298347","20162501","UofT",NA,2017

An open question in symbiosis research is the extent to which environmental influence, including the exchange of microbes between interacting macroorganisms, affects the composition and function of symbiotic microbial communities. Herewe approached this question by investigating symbiosis within symbiosis. Ant–plant–hemipteran symbioses are hallmarks of tropical ecosystems that produce persistent close contact among the macroorganism partners, which then have substantial opportunity to exchange symbiotic microbes. We used metabarcoding and quantitative PCR to examine community structure of both bacteria and fungi in a Neotropical ant–plant–scale-insect symbiosis. Both phloem-feeding scale insects and honeydew-feeding ants make use of microbial symbionts to subsist on phloem-derived diets of suboptimal nutritional quality. Among the insects examined here, Cephalotes ants and pseudococcid scale insects had the most specialized bacterial symbionts, whereas Azteca ants appeared to consume or associate with more fungi than bacteria, and coccid scale insects were associated with unusually diverse bacterial communities. Despite these differences, we also identified apparent sharing of microbes among the macro-partners. How microbial exchanges affect the consumerresource interactions that shape the evolution of ant–plant–hemipteran symbioses is an exciting question that awaits further research.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","Bacteria | Cordia alliodora | Fungi | Metabarcoding | Myrmecophyte | Scale insects","130030","DEB-1442316","National Science Foundation","1","TRUE","806","284","1850","28298351","20162770",NA,NA,2017

Blooms of alien invasive marine algae have become common, greatly altering the health and stability of nearshore marine ecosystems. Concurrently, herbivorous fishes have been severely overfished in many locations worldwide, contributing to increases in macroalgal cover. We used a multi-pronged, interdisciplinary approach to test if higher biomass of herbivorous fishes inside a no-take marine reserve makes this area more resistant to invasive algal overgrowth. Over a two year time period, we (1) compared fish biomass and algal cover between two fished and one unfished patch reef in Hawai'i, (2) used acoustic telemetry to determine fidelity of herbivorous fishes to the unfished reef, and (3) used metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing to determine diet composition of herbivorous fishes. Herbivore fish biomass was significantly higher in the marine reserve compared to adjacent fished reefs, whereas invasive algal cover differed by species. Herbivorous fish movements were largely confined to the unfished patch reef where they were captured. Diet analysis indicated that the consumption of invasive algae varied among fish species, with a high prevalence of comparatively rare native algal species. Together these findings demonstrate that the contribution of herbivores to coral reef resilience, via resistance to invasive algae invasion, is complex and species-specific.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"21100200805","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","807","7",NA,"28276458","43819",NA,"srep43819",2017

A bioinformatics pipeline has recently been published for identification using a comprehensive database of ITS2, one of the common plant DNA barcoding markers. There is, however, no corresponding database for rbcL, the other primary marker used in plants. Methods: Using publicly available data, we compiled a reference library of rbcL sequences and trained databases for use with UTAX and RDP classifier algorithms. We used this reference library, along with the existing bioinformatics pipeline and ITS2 reference library, to identify species in an artificial mixture of nine species of pollen. We have made this database publicly available in multiple formats, to allow use with multiple bioinformatics pipelines, now and in the future. Results: Using the rbcL database, in addition to the ITS2 database, we succeeded in making species-level identifications for eight species and a family-level identification of the ninth species. This is an improvement on ITS2 sequence alone. Discussion: The reference library described here will assist with identification of plant species using rbcL. By making another gene region available for standard barcoding, this will increase the resolution and accuracy of identifications.","11","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","DNA barcoding | DNA metabarcoding | plastid DNA | rbcL | species identification","21100403506","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","808","5","3",NA,"1600110",NA,NA,2017

Studying the ecology of sand flies is crucial to understand the epidemiology of leishmaniasis and further control this disease. A major limitation in this regard is that traditional morphological-based methods for sand fly species identifications are time-consuming and require taxonomic expertise. DNA metabarcoding holds great promise in overcoming this issue by allowing the identification of multiple species from a single bulk sample. Here, we assessed the reliability of a short insect metabarcode located in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA for the identification of Neotropical sand flies, and constructed a reference database for 40 species found in French Guiana. Then, we conducted a metabarcoding experiment on sand flies mixtures of known content and showed that the method allows an accurate identification of specimens in pools. Finally, we applied metabarcoding to field samples caught in a 1-ha forest plot in French Guiana. Besides providing reliable molecular data for species-level assignations of phlebotomine sand flies, our study proves the efficiency of metabarcoding based on the mitochondrial 16S rRNA for studying sand fly diversity from bulk samples.

A better understanding of the rumen ecosystem is essential to increase productivity or decrease methane production. Samples were collected from the three main rumen environments: the solid-adherent fraction, the liquid fraction and the epithelium. For the liquid and solid fraction, two alternative sample processing protocols were compared, resulting in a total of five sample types: crude solids (S), the eluted solid-adherent fraction (Ad), free-living species in the crude rumen liquid (CRL), strained liquid samples (Lq) and epimural scrapings (Ep). The bacterial and methanogen communities of these sample types were analysed using 16S metabarcoding and qPCR. The results indicate that the liquid and solid-adherent environments are distinguished mainly by the differential abundance of specific taxonomic groups. Cellulolytic bacteria that pioneer biofilm formation, together with secondary colonisers are prevalent in solid-adherent samples, while dominant species in the fluid samples are primarily identified as consumers of soluble nutrients. Also, methanogen species are found to have a preference for either a solid-adherent or free-living occurrence. The epimural environment is characterised by a different microbial profile. Ten bacterial families and two methanogen genera are almost exclusively found in this environment.","12","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","environments | epimural | methanogen | rumen","19705","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","812","93","3","28011597",NA,NA,NA,2017

To make oribatid mites an applicable tool in monitoring programs it is necessary to find a molecular species marker that allows distinct, rapid and easy species identification. In previous studies, the common barcoding sequence COI showed to be too variable to serve as species marker in oribatid mites. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the potential use of the D3 region of the nuclear 28S rDNA gene for species identification. Therefore, we generated a reference DNA library of 28S D3 to identify specimens of the Oribatida from Germany, with focus on species occurring in peatlands being one of the most endangered habitats in Europe. New DNA sequences were obtained from 325 individuals and 64 species (58 genera, 34 families). By adding 28S D3-sequences from GenBank we altogether analysed 385 sequences from 89 German species, 32 of them restricted to peatlands and further 42 occurring in peatlands occasionally, representing 46 and 33% of the oribatids in German peatlands, respectively. P-distances were measured between species within families as well as for intraspecific divergence. 28S D3 showed low intraspecific genetic p-distances between 0 and 0.5%, interspecific distances within families varied between 0 and 9.7%. Most species pairs within families were further separated by one to four indels in addition to substitutions. Altogether, 93% of all analysed species are clearly delineated by 28S D3. Our study emphasises that 28S D3 rDNA is a useful barcode for the identification of oribatid mite specimens and represents an important step in building-up a comprehensive barcode library to allow metabarcoding analyses of environmental peatland samples for Oribatida in Germany as well as in Central Europe.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","28S D3 | Barcode | Germany | Indels | Mites | Peatlands","21504","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","813","71","3","28405837",NA,NA,NA,2017

Prokaryotic communities forming symbiotic relationships with the vent shrimp, Rimicaris exoculata, are well studied components of hydrothermal ecosystems at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Despite the tight link between host and symbiont, the observed lack of spatial genetic structure seen in R. exoculata contrasts with the geographic differentiation detected in specific bacterial ectosymbionts. The geographic clustering of bacterial lineages within a seemingly panmictic host suggests either the presence of finer scale restriction to gene flow not yet detected in the host, horizontal transmission (environmental selection) of its endosymbionts as a consequence of unique vent geochemistry, or vertically transmitted endosymbionts that exhibit genetic differentiation. To identify which hypothesis best fits, we tested whether bacterial assemblages exhibit differentiation across sites or host populations by performing a 16S rRNA metabarcoding survey on R. exoculata digestive prokaryote samples (n = 31) taken from three geochemically distinct vents across MAR: Rainbow, Trans- Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) and Logatchev. Analysis of communities across two organs (digestive tract, stomach), three molt colors (white, red, black) and three life stages (eggs, juveniles, adults) also provided insights into symbiont transmission mode. Examining both whole communities and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) confirmed the presence of three main epibionts: Epsilonproteobacteria, Mollicutes and Deferribacteres. With these findings, we identified a clear pattern of geographic segregation by vent in OTUs assigned to Epsilonproteobacteria. Additionally, we detected evidence for differentiation among all communities associated to vents and life stages. Overall, results suggest a combination of environmental selection and vertical inheritance of some of the symbiotic lineages.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","814","12","3","28296889","e0172543",NA,NA,2017

Fast, accurate and thorough assessments of meiofaunal communities are crucial requirements for ecological studies and routine monitoring of ecosystem status. This study scrutinizes the reliability of the molecular approach through a comparison of morphological and molecular inventories of meiofaunal diversity, with a special focus on nematodes. Sediment samples were collected from a reference coastal Mediterranean site. Metabarcoding analysis was performed using a nuclear marker (small subunit 18S ribosomal RNA) and compared to a morphological analysis performed on the same sample-cores. The results from morphological and molecular inventories differed but were complementary. The molecular analysis revealed a remarkable level of diversity (16 phyla) that exceeded the traditional morphological analysis (10 phyla), showing that meiofaunal diversity can greatly exceed current perceptions. The molecular method proved powerful in detecting the presence of soft-bodied predators, such as Platyhelminthes, possibly reflecting preservation bias in morphological approaches. Even if the molecular inventory identified 57.5% of the sampled diversity, surprisingly, it has not revealed the presence of some nematode genera identified through morphological assessment. While the technique is promising, some further developments are required. As the dominant genus Sabatieria was undetected by the molecular approach, despite being present in the Silva database, improving the knowledge of specific primers should be a priority. Additionally, with 77% of nematode OTUs remaining unassigned at genera level, remedy this lower efficiency requires further investigations to provide DNA-sequences of all morphologically identified species.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"12165","J091I006","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","0","FALSE","815","164","3",NA,"40",NA,NA,2017

Wide-scale application of biochar to soil has been suggested as a mechanism to offset increases in CO2 emissions through the long-term sequestration of a carbon rich and inert substance to the soil, but the implications of this for soil diversity and function remain to be determined. Biochar is capable of inducing changes in soil bacterial communities, but the exact impacts of its application are poorly understood. Using three European sites [UK SRC, short rotation coppice, French grassland (FR) and Italian SRF, short rotation forestry (IT)] treated with identical biochar applications, we undertook 16S and ITS amplicon DNA sequencing. In addition, we carried out assessments of community change over time and N and P mobilization in the UK. Significant changes in bacterial and community structure occurred due to treatment, although the nature of the changes varied by site. STAMP differential abundance analysis showed enrichment of Gemmatimonadete and Acidobacteria in UK biochar plots 1 year after application, whilst control plots exhibited enriched Gemmataceae, Isosphaeraceae and Koribacteraceae. Increased mobility of ammonium and phosphates was also detected after 1 year, coupled with a shift from acid to alkaline phosphomonoesterase activity, which may suggest an ecological and functional shift towards a more copiotrophic ecology. Italy also exhibited enrichments, in both the Proteobacteria (driven by an increase in the order Rhizobiales) and the Gemmatimonadetes. No significant change in the abundance of individual taxa was noted in FR, although a small significant change in unweighted UNIFRAC occurred, indicating variation in the identities of taxa present due to treatment. Fungal ß diversity was affected by treatment in IT and FR, but was unaffected in UK samples. The effects of time and site were greater than that of biochar application in UK samples. Overall, this report gives a tantalizing view of the soil microbiome at several sites across Europe and suggests that although application of biochar has significant effects on microbial communities, these may be small compared with the highly variable soil microbiome that is found in different soils and changes with time.","25","Journal","ar","Article","100","14","16SrDNA | Acidobacteria | Alphaproteobacteria Bacteria | amplicon | biochar | fungi | ITS | metabarcoding | microbiome | Proteobacteria | Rhizobiales | soil","21100216308","262060","University of Southampton","1","TRUE","817","9","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

This marine protist is commonly used in micropalaeontological investigations of climatically sensitive subpolar and temperate water masses as well as wind-driven upwelling regions of the world's oceans. <i>G. bulloides</i> is unusual because it lacks the protist algal symbionts that are often found in other spinose species.

This is suggestive of novel differences in ecology and life history of <i>G. bulloides</i>, making it a good candidate for investigating the potential for bacterial symbiosis as a contributory factor influencing shell calcification. Such information is essential to evaluate fully the potential response of <i>G. bulloides</i> to ocean acidification and climate change. To investigate possible ecological interactions between <i>G. bulloides</i> and marine bacteria, 18S rRNA gene sequencing, fluorescence microscopy, 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed on individual specimens of <i>G. bulloides</i> (type IId) collected from two locations in the California Current.

Background: Fungi are among the most abundant and diverse organisms on Earth. However, a substantial amount of the species diversity, relationships, habitats, and life strategies of these microorganisms remain to be discovered and characterized. One important factor hindering progress is the difficulty in correctly identifying fungi. Morphological and molecular characteristics have been applied in such tasks. Later, DNA barcoding has emerged as a new method for the rapid and reliable identification of species. The nrITS region is considered the universal barcode of Fungi, and the ITS1 and ITS2 sub-regions have been applied as metabarcoding markers. In this study, we performed a large-scale analysis of all the available Basidiomycota sequences from GenBank. We carried out a rigorous trimming of the initial dataset based in methodological principals of DNA Barcoding. Two different approaches (PCI and barcode gap) were used to determine the performance of the complete ITS region and sub-regions. Results: For most of the Basidiomycota genera, the three genomic markers performed similarly, i.e., when one was considered a good marker for the identification of a genus, the others were also; the same results were observed when the performance was insufficient. However, based on barcode gap analyses, we identified genomic markers that had a superior identification performance than the others and genomic markers that were not indicated for the identification of some genera. Notably, neither the complete ITS nor the sub-regions were useful in identifying 11 of the 113 Basidiomycota genera. The complex phylogenetic relationships and the presence of cryptic species in some genera are possible explanations of this limitation and are discussed. Conclusions: Knowledge regarding the efficiency and limitations of the barcode markers that are currently used for the identification of organisms is crucial because it benefits research in many areas. Our study provides information that may guide researchers in choosing the most suitable genomic markers for identifying Basidiomycota species.","14","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Barcode gap | Basidiomycota | ITS | ITS1 | ITS2 | Probable correct identification","19633","undefined","Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais","1","TRUE","819","17","1","28228107","42","CNPq",NA,2017

DNA metabarcoding is a promising approach for rapidly surveying biodiversity and is likely to become an important tool for measuring ecosystem responses to environmental change. Metabarcoding markers need sufficient taxonomic coverage to detect groups of interest, sufficient sequence divergence to resolve species, and will ideally indicate relative abundance of taxa present. We characterized zooplankton assemblages with three different metabarcoding markers (nuclear 18S rDNA, mitochondrial COI, and mitochondrial 16S rDNA) to compare their performance in terms of taxonomic coverage, taxonomic resolution, and correspondence between morphology- and DNA-based identification. COI amplicons sequenced on separate runs showed that operational taxonomic units representing >0.1% of reads per sample were highly reproducible, although slightly more taxa were detected using a lower annealing temperature. Mitochondrial COI and nuclear 18S showed similar taxonomic coverage across zooplankton phyla. However, mitochondrial COI resolved up to threefold more taxa to species compared to 18S. All markers revealed similar patterns of beta-diversity, although different taxa were identified as the greatest contributors to these patterns for 18S. For calanoid copepod families, all markers displayed a positive relationship between biomass and sequence reads, although the relationship was typically strongest for 18S. The use of COI for metabarcoding has been questioned due to lack of conserved primer-binding sites. However, our results show the taxonomic coverage and resolution provided by degenerate COI primers, combined with a comparatively well-developed reference sequence database, make them valuable metabarcoding markers for biodiversity assessment.","24","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","cytochrome oxidase subunit I | environmental DNA | metabarcoding | mitochondrial 16S ribosomal DNA | nuclear 18S rDNA | zooplankton","21100264002","2014/031","University of Tasmania","1","TRUE","824","7","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Because biofilms that survive cleaning cycles become resistant over time, prevention strategies limiting the adhesion of bacteria to membranes should be prioritized for sustainable control of biofouling. However, this cannot be achieved because the pioneer bacteria colonizing these membranes are still unknown. Consequently, the objective of this study was to characterize pioneer bacteria on the filtration membrane surface and to measure the effect of filtration operational parameters on their diversity. Thus, milk and cheese whey were filtered for 5 h in concentration mode at 10 and 40°C using a laboratory-scale crossflow filtration system equipped with flat-sheet ultrafiltration membranes. Pioneer colonizer bacteria found on membranes after a chlorinated alkaline cleaning cycle were identified using a metabarcoding approach targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Our results suggested that prevention strategies targeting biofouling should consider the nature of the filtered fluid and the feed temperature (36.15 and 5.09% of the variances observed on membranes, respectively), as well as the microbial environment of the dairy processing plant. In the future, it is hypothesized that cleaning prevention strategies will be specific to each dairy processor and their operational parameters.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","biofilm | dairy processing | metabarcoding | pioneer bacteria | ultrafiltration","32795","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","825","100","2","27889129",NA,NA,"S002203021630830X",2017

Analysis of physical evidence is typically a deciding factor in forensic casework by establishing what transpired at a scene or who was involved. Forensic geoscience is an emerging multi-disciplinary science that can offer significant benefits to forensic investigations. Soil is a powerful, nearly 'ideal' contact trace evidence, as it is highly individualistic, easy to characterise, has a high transfer and retention probability, and is often overlooked in attempts to conceal evidence. However, many real-life cases encounter close proximity soil samples or soils with low inorganic content, which cannot be easily discriminated based on current physical and chemical analysis techniques. The capability to improve forensic soil discrimination, and identify key indicator taxa from soil using the organic fraction is currently lacking. The development of new DNA sequencing technologies offers the ability to generate detailed genetic profiles from soils and enhance current forensic soil analyses. Here, we discuss the use of DNA metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology to distinguish between soils from different locations in a forensic context. Specifically, we provide recommendations for best practice, outline the potential limitations encountered in a forensic context and describe the future directions required to integrate soil DNA analysis into casework.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","DNA | forensic | geoscience | high-throughput sequencing | Soil","19705","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","826","93","2","27979996",NA,NA,NA,2017

An increasing number of studies use next generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze complex communities, but is the method sensitive enough when it comes to identification and quantification of species? We compared NGS with morphology-based identification methods in an analysis of microalgal (periphyton) communities. We conducted a mesocosm experiment in which we allowed two benthic grazer species to feed upon benthic biofilms, which resulted in altered periphyton communities. Morphology-based identification and 454 (Roche) pyrosequencing of the V4 region in the small ribosomal unit (18S) rDNA gene were used to investigate the community change caused by grazing. Both the NGS-based data and the morphology-based method detected a marked shift in the biofilm composition, though the two methods varied strongly in their abilities to detect and quantify specific taxa, and neither method was able to detect all species in the biofilms.

Methods in Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society. DNA metabarcoding of food in animal scats provides a non-invasive dietary analysis method for vertebrates. A variety of molecular approaches can be used to recover dietary DNA from scats; however, many of these also recover non-food DNA. Blocking primers can be used to inhibit amplification of some non-target DNA, but this may not always be feasible, especially when multiple distinct non-target groups are present. We have developed scat collection protocols to optimise the detection of food DNA in vertebrate scat samples. Using shy albatross Thalassarche cauta as a case study, we investigated how DNA amplification success and the proportion of food DNA detected are influenced by both environmental and physiological parameters. We show that both the amount and type of non-target DNA vary with sample freshness, the collection substrate, fasting period and developmental stage of the consumer. Fresh scat samples yielded the highest proportion of food sequences. Collecting scats from dirt substrates reduced the proportion of food DNA and increased the proportion of contaminating DNA. Food DNA detection rates changed throughout the albatross breeding season and related to the time since feeding and the developmental stage of the animal. Fasting albatross produced scats dominated by parasite amplicons in universal PCR analysis, with little food DNA recovered. Samples from very young animals also produced reduced food DNA proportions. Based on our observations, we recommend the following procedures for field scat collections to ensure high-quality samples for dietary DNA metabarcoding studies. Ideally, (i) collect fresh scats; (ii) from surfaces with minimal contamination (e.g. rock or ice); (iii) collect scats from animals with minimum time since feeding and avoid fasting animals; (iv) avoid young animals that are not feeding directly (e.g. not weaned or fledged) or target larger/older individuals. The optimised field sampling protocols that we describe will improve the quality of dietary data from vertebrates by focusing on samples most likely to contain food DNA. They will also help minimise contamination issues from non-target DNA and provide standardised field methods in this rapidly expanding area of research.","18","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","albatross | cestoda | faeces | food | molecular | non-invasive | parasites | prey | procellariiformes | seabird","21100217611","TFA 14049","University of Tasmania","1","TRUE","828","8","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Ice-free regions of Antarctica are concentrated along the coastal margins but are scarce throughout the continental interior. Environmental changes, including the introduction of non-indigenous species, increasingly threaten these unique habitats. At the same time, the unique biotic communities subsisting in isolation across the continent are difficult to survey due to logistical constraints, sampling challenges and problems related to the identification of small and cryptic taxa. Baseline biodiversity data from remote Antarctic habitats are still missing for many parts of the continent but are critical to the detection of community changes over time, including newly introduced species. Here we review the potential of standardized (non-specialist) sampling in the field (e.g. from soil, vegetation or water) combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of bulk DNA as a possible solution to overcome some of these problems. In particular, HTS metabarcoding approaches benefit from being able to process many samples in parallel, while workflow and data structure can stay highly uniform. Such approaches have quickly gained recognition and we show that HTS metabarcoding surveys are likely to play an important role in continent-wide biomonitoring of all Antarctic terrestrial habitats.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","conservation | cryptic taxa | high-throughput sequencing | invasive taxa | Key words biomonitoring","13040","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","829","29","1",NA,NA,NA,"S0954102016000389",2017

These resting stages accumulate in the sediments where they can remain for a long time before being re-suspended in the water column and switching to active growth. Until now, the abundance and diversity of viable diatom resting stages have been assessed using the Serial Dilution Culture (SDC) method. In the present study, surface sediment samples from the Gulf of Naples were used to compare results obtained with the SDC method with those provided by HTS metabarcoding based on DNA extracted from the same sediment sample; the marker used was the V4 region of 18S rDNA. HTS metabarcoding showed a marked dominance of polar centric diatoms, among which Chaetoceros species were the most represented, in terms of both sequence and ribotype number. Almost all the most abundant ribotypes identified with metabarcoding matched records of species observed in SDCs. In some cases, however, this marker region could not distinguish between morphologically and phylogenetically distinct species, e.g., Skeletonema pseudocostatum and S. tropicum. As expected, molecular analysis provided a higher number of ribotypes as compared to the number of taxa recorded by SDC. Despite the well-known biases of both methodologies for quantitative assessments, our results show that DNA metabarcoding via HTS sequencing is a promising approach to explore the diversity of diatom resting stages. This study also confirms the importance of curated reference sequences to fully interpret the diversity stored in environmental sediment samples.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","18S rDNA | Diatoms | Gulf of Naples | hTS | lTeR-MC | metabarcoding | resting stages | SDC | sediments | V4","17910","1555",NA,"0","FALSE","830","38","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Taxonomic identification of pollen has historically been accomplished via light microscopy but requires specialized knowledge and reference collections, particularly when identification to lower taxonomic levels is necessary. Recently, next-generation sequencing technology has been used as a cost-effective alternative for identifying beecollected pollen; however, this novel approach has not been tested on a spatially or temporally robust number of pollen samples. Here, we compare pollen identification results derived from light microscopy and DNA sequencing techniques with samples collected from honey bee colonies embedded within a gradient of intensive agricultural landscapes in the Northern Great Plains throughout the 2010-2011 growing seasons. We demonstrate that at all taxonomic levels, DNA sequencing was able to discern a greater number of taxa, and was particularly useful for the identification of infrequently detected species. Importantly, substantial phenological overlap did occur for commonly detected taxa using either technique, suggesting that DNA sequencing is an appropriate, and enhancing, substitutive technique for accurately capturing the breadth of bee-collected species of pollen present across agricultural landscapes. We also show that honey bees located in high and low intensity agricultural settings forage on dissimilar plants, though with overlap of the most abundantly collected pollen taxa. We highlight practical applications of utilizing sequencing technology, including addressing ecological issues surrounding land use, climate change, importance of taxa relative to abundance, and evaluating the impact of conservation program habitat enhancement efforts.","15","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Agriculture | Honey bee | Land use | Pollen identification","20311","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","833","46","1","28062536",NA,NA,NA,2017

High levels of halophilic and stress-resistant bacteria and fungi were identified, able to grow at high temperatures, salt and UV levels, and in the presence of low moisture and toxic fossil fuel emissions. Many produced pigments, adding to the discoloration of the stone surface. The most abundant bacterial group was the Actinobacteria, which can burrow into the compromised rock and produce organic acids that further degrade the substrate. Geodermatophilaceae and Micrococcaceae were the major bacterial families. The majority of the fungi identified were dimorphic and present on the façade in their yeast forms, with few filamentous fungi being seen in the scanning electron microscope.

Animal bodies are inhabited by a taxonomically and functionally diverse community of symbiotic and commensal microorganisms. From an ecological and evolutionary perspective, inter-individual variation in host-associated microbiota contributes to physiological and immune system variation. As such, host-associated microbiota may be considered an integral part of the host's phenotype, serving as a substrate for natural selection. This assumes that host-associated microbiota exhibits high temporal stability, however, and that its composition is shaped by trans-generational transfer or heritable host-associated microbiota modulators encoded by the host genome. Although this concept is widely accepted, its crucial assumptions have rarely been tested in wild vertebrate populations. We performed 16S rRNA metabarcoding on an extensive set of fecal microbiota (FM) samples from an insectivorous, long-distance migratory bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). Our data revealed clear differences in FM among juveniles and adults as regards taxonomic and functional composition, diversity and co-occurrence network complexity. Multiple FM samples from the same juvenile or adult collected within single breeding seasons exhibited higher similarity than expected by chance, as did adult FM samples over two consecutive years. Despite low effect sizes for FM stability over time at the community level, we identified an adult FM subset with relative abundances exhibiting significant temporal consistency, possibly inducing long-term effects on the host phenotype. Our data also indicate a slight maternal (but not paternal) effect on FM composition in social offspring, though this is unlikely to persist into adulthood. We discuss our findings in the context of both evolution and ecology of microbiota vs. host interactions and barn swallow biology.","12","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Barn swallow | Fecal microbiota | Gastrointestinal tract | Metagenome | Microbiome | Symbiosis","21100226442","260 313/2016","Grantová Agentura Ceské Republiky","1","TRUE","835","8","FEB",NA,"50",NA,NA,2017

As an alternative, we developed metacoder, an R package for easily parsing, manipulating, and graphing publication-ready plots of hierarchical data. Metacoder includes a dynamic and flexible function that can parse most text-based formats that contain taxonomic classifications, taxon names, taxon identifiers, or sequence identifiers. Metacoder can then subset, sample, and order this parsed data using a set of intuitive functions that take into account the hierarchical nature of the data. Finally, an extremely flexible plotting function enables quantitative representation of up to 4 arbitrary statistics simultaneously in a tree format by mapping statistics to the color and size of tree nodes and edges. Metacoder also allows exploration of barcode primer bias by integrating functions to run digital PCR.

B1 and A4 are the overall dominant clades and different clades seem to occupy distinct niches, for example, A6 is dominant in surface Mediterranean Sea waters, whereas A4 extend to high temperate latitudes. Our work demonstrates that prasinophytes clade VII constitute a highly diversified group, which is a key component of phytoplankton in open oceanic waters but has been neglected in the conceptualization of marine microbial diversity and carbon cycle.","15","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"5800173382","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","838","11","2","27779617",NA,NA,NA,2017

The induction of necrotic leaf lesions coincided with escalation of H. fraxineus DNA levels and changes in proportion of biotrophs, followed by an increase of ubiquitous endophytes with pathogenic potential. H. fraxineus uses high propagule pressure to establish in leaves as quiescent thalli that switch to pathogenic mode once these thalli reach a certain threshold – the massive feedback from the saprophytic phase enables this fungus to challenge host defenses and the resident competitors in mid-season when their density in host tissues is still low. Despite the general correspondence between the ITS-1 and ITS-2 datasets, marker biases were observed, which suggests that multiple barcodes provide better overall representation of mycobiomes.","13","Journal","ar","Article","100","12","ash dieback | Hymenoscyphus fraxineus | indigenous fungi | internal transcribed spacer (ITS) | invasive pathogens | metabarcoding","19908","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","839","213","3","27716950",NA,NA,NA,2017

When compared to surface ecosystems, groundwater sampling has unique constraints, including limited access to ecosystems through wells. In order to monitor groundwater, a detailed understanding of groundwater biota and what biological sampling of wells truly reflects, is paramount. This study aims to address this uncertainty, comparing the composition of biota in groundwater wells prior to and after purging, with samples collected prior to purging reflecting a potentially artificial environment and samples collected after purging representing the surrounding aquifer. This study uses DNA community profiling (metabarcoding) of 16S rDNA and 18S rDNA, combined with traditional stygofauna sampling methods, to characterise groundwater biota from four catchments within eastern Australia. Aquifer waters were dominated by Archaea and bacteria (e.g. Nitrosopumilales) that are often associated with nitrification processes, and contained a greater proportion of bacteria (e.g. Anaerolineales) associated with fermenting processes compared to well waters. In contrast, unpurged wells contained greater proportions of pathogenic bacteria and bacteria often associated with denitrification processes. In terms of eukaryotes, the abundances of copepods, syncarids and oligochaetes and total abundances of stygofauna were greater in wells than aquifers.

Background By the end of this century, the potential climate-biome of the southern Kenai Peninsula is forecasted to change from transitional boreal forest to prairie and grasslands, a scenario that may already be playing out in the Caribou Hills region. Here, spruce (Picea × lutzii Little [glauca × sitchensis]) forests were heavily thinned by an outbreak of the spruce bark beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby, 1837)) and replaced by the native but invasive grass species, Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.) P. Beauv. As part of a project designed to delimit and characterize potentially expanding grasslands in this region, we sought to characterize the arthropod and earthworm communities of these grasslands. We also used this sampling effort as a trial of applying high-throughput sequencing metabarcoding methods to a real-world inventory of terrestrial arthropods. New information We documented 131 occurrences of 67 native arthropod species at ten sites, characterizing the arthropod fauna of these grasslands as being dominated by Hemiptera (60% of total reads) and Diptera (38% of total reads). We found a single exotic earthworm species, Dendrobaena octaedra (Savigny, 1826), at 30% of sites and one unidentified enchytraeid at a single site.

Given the rapid rise of environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys in ecology and environmental science, it is important to be able to compare the results of these surveys to traditional methods of measuring biodiversity. Here we compare samples from a traditional method (a manual tow-net) to companion eDNA samples sequenced at three different genetic loci. We find only partial taxonomic overlap among the resulting datasets, with each reflecting a portion of the larger suite of taxa present in the sampled nearshore marine environment. In the larger context of eDNA sequencing surveys, our results suggest that primer amplification bias drives much of the taxonomic bias in eDNA detection, and that the baseline probability of detecting any given taxon with a broad-spectrum primer set is likely to be low. Whether catching fish with different nets or using different PCR primer sets, multiple data types can provide complementary views of a common ecosystem. However, it remains difficult to cross-validate eDNA sequencing techniques in the field, either for presence/absence or for abundance, particularly for primer sets that target very wide taxonomic ranges. Finally, our results highlight the breadth of diversity in a single habitat, and although eDNA does capture a richer sample of the community than traditional methods of sampling, a large number of eDNA primer sets focusing on different subsets of the biota would be necessary to survey any ecological community in a reasonably comprehensive way.","22","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Environmental monitoring | Estuarine | Marine | Metabarcoding | Metagenomics | Molecular ecology","21100790929","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","845","3","JAN",NA,"283",NA,NA,2017

The objective of this research was to develop a multi-locus DNA metabarcoding method for forensic wildlife species identification and to evaluate the applicability and reproducibility of this approach across different laboratories. A DNA metabarcoding method was developed that makes use of 12 DNA barcode markers that have demonstrated universal applicability across a wide range of plant and animal taxa and that facilitate the identification of species in samples containing degraded DNA. The DNA metabarcoding method was developed based on Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of well-defined experimental mixtures, for which a bioinformatics pipeline with user-friendly web-interface was developed. The performance of the DNA metabarcoding method was assessed in an international validation trial by 16 laboratories, in which the method was found to be highly reproducible and sensitive enough to identify species present in a mixture at 1% dry weight content. The advanced multi-locus DNA metabarcoding method assessed in this study provides reliable and detailed data on the composition of complex food products, including information on the presence of CITES-listed species.

Moreover, the impact of tea type (green or black) on microbial ecology was not studied. Here, we compared microbial communities from industrial-scale black and green tea fermentations, still traditionally carried out by a microbial biofilm, using culture-dependent and metabarcoding approaches. Dominant bacterial species belonged to Acetobacteraceae and to a lesser extent Lactobacteriaceae, while the main identified yeasts corresponded to Dekkera, Hanseniaspora and Zygosaccharomyces during all fermentations. Species richness decreased over the 8-day fermentation. Among acetic acid bacteria, Gluconacetobacter europaeus, Gluconobacter oxydans, G. saccharivorans and Acetobacter peroxydans emerged as dominant species. The main lactic acid bacteria, Oenococcus oeni, was strongly associated with green tea fermentations. Tea type did not influence yeast community, with Dekkera bruxellensis, D. anomala, Zygosaccharomyces bailii and Hanseniaspora valbyensis as most dominant.

Although they are widespread, diverse and involved in biogeochemical cycles, microbial eukaryotes attract less attention than their prokaryotic counterparts in environmental microbiology. In this study, we used publicly available 18S barcoding data to define biases that may limit such analyses and to gain an overview of the planktonic microbial eukaryotic diversity in freshwater ecosystems. The richness of the microbial eukaryotes was estimated to 100 798 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) delineating 1267 clusters or phylogenetic units (PUs, i.e. monophyletic groups of OTUs that are phylogenetically close). By summing the richness found in aquatic environments, we can predict the microbial eukaryotic richness to be around 200 000-250 000 species. The molecular diversity of protists in freshwater environments is generally higher than that of the morphospecies and cultivated species catalogued in public databases. Amoebozoa, Viridiplantae, Ichthyosporea, and Cryptophyta are the most phylogenetically diverse taxa, and characterisation of these groups is still needed.

Veronica officinalis L. (common speedwell), a member of Plantaginaceae family, has a long history of use in European traditional medicine, mainly in central eastern Europe and the Balkans. However, no specified control tests are available either to establish the quality of derived herbal products or for the discrimination of its most common substitute, V. chamaedrys L.

In this study, we use DNA metabarcoding and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) to authenticate sixteen V. officinalis herbal products and compare the potential of the two approaches to detect substitution, adulteration and the use of unreported constituents. HPLC-MS showed high resolution in detecting phytochemical target compounds, but did not enable detection of specific plant species in the products. DNA metabarcoding detected V. officinalis in only 15% of the products, whereas it detected V. chamaedrys in 62% of the products. The results confirm that DNA metabarcoding can be used to test for the presence of Veronica species, and detect substitution and/or admixture of other Veronica species, as well as simultaneously detect all other species present. Our results confirm that none of the herbal products contained exactly the species listed on the label, and all included substitutes, contaminants or fillers. This study highlights the need for authentication of raw herbals along the value chain of these products.

Our objective was to determine how spatial distribution of samples and “bioinformatic stringency” affected eDNA-metabarcoding estimates of species richness compared with capture-based estimates in a 2.2 ha reservoir. When bioinformatic criteria required species to be detected only in a single sample, eDNA metabarcoding detected all species captured with traditional methods plus an additional 11 noncaptured species. However, when we required species to be detected with multiple markers and in multiple samples, eDNA metabarcoding detected only seven of the captured species. Our analysis of the spatial patterns of species detection indicated that eDNA was distributed relatively homogeneously throughout the reservoir, except near the inflowing stream. We suggest that interpretation of eDNA metabarcoding data must consider the potential effects of water body type, spatial resolution, and bioinformatic stringency.","15","Journal","ar","Article","100","10",NA,"12016","W912HQ-12-C-0073","Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program","0","FALSE","853","74","9",NA,NA,"SERDP",NA,2017

One approach in particular, DNA metabarcoding, can provide unprecedented taxonomic breadth at a scale not practically achievable through the morphological identification of individual organisms.

Sequencing environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly being used as an alternative to traditional morphological-based identification to characterize biological assemblages and monitor anthropogenic impacts in marine environments. Most studies only assess eDNA which, compared to eRNA, can persist longer in the environment after cell death. Therefore, eRNA may provide a more immediate census of the environment due to its relatively weaker stability, leading some researchers to advocate for the use of eRNA as an additional, or perhaps superior proxy for portraying ecological changes. A variety of pre-treatment techniques for screening eDNA and eRNA derived operational taxonomic units (OTUs) have been employed prior to statistical analyses, including removing singleton taxa (i.e., OTUs found only once) and discarding those not present in both eDNA and eRNA datasets. In this study, we used bacterial (16S ribosomal RNA gene) and eukaryotic (18S ribosomal RNA gene) eDNA- and eRNA-derived data from benthic communities collected at increasing distances along a transect from an oil production platform (Taranaki, New Zealand). Macro-infauna (visual classification of benthic invertebrates) and physico-chemical data were analyzed in parallel. We tested the effect of removing singleton taxa, and removing taxa not present in the eDNA and eRNA libraries from the same environmental sample (trimmed by shared OTUs), by comparing the impact of the oil production platform on alpha- and betadiversity of the eDNA/eRNA-based biological assemblages, and by correlating these to the morphologically identified macro-faunal communities and the physico-chemical data. When trimmed by singletons, presence/absence information from eRNA data represented the best proxy to detect changes on species diversity for both bacteria and eukaryotes. However, assessment of quantitative beta-diversity from read abundance information of bacteria eRNA did not, contrary to eDNA, reveal any impact from the oil production activity. Overall, the data appeared more robust when trimmed by shared OTUs, showing a greater effect of the platform on alpha- and beta-diversity. Trimming by shared OTUs likely removes taxa derived from legacy DNA and technical artefacts introduced through reverse transcriptase, polymerase-chain-reaction and sequencing. Findings from our scoping study suggest that metabarcoding-based biomonitoring surveys should, if funds, time and expertise allow, be assessed using both eDNA and eRNA products.","20","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Bacteria (16S) | Benthic ecology | Biomonitoring | eDNA | eRNA | Eukaryotes (18S) | High-throughput sequencing | Method testing | Oil and gas activities","21100239256","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","855","2017","5",NA,"e3347",NA,NA,2017

DNA metabarcoding, the PCR-based profiling of natural communities, is becoming the method of choice for biodiversity monitoring because it circumvents some of the limitations inherent to traditional ecological surveys. However, potential sources of bias that can affect the reproducibility of this method remain to be quantified. The interpretation of differences in patterns of sequence abundance and the ecological relevance of rare sequences remain particularly uncertain. Here we used one artificial mock community to explore the significance of abundance patterns and disentangle the effects of two potential biases on data reproducibility: indexed PCR primers and random sampling during Illumina MiSeq sequencing. We amplified a short fragment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I (COI) for a single mock sample containing equimolar amounts of total genomic DNA from 34 marine invertebrates belonging to six phyla. We used seven indexed broad-range primers and sequenced the resulting library on two consecutive Illumina MiSeq runs. The total number of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) was ~4 times higher than expected based on the composition of the mock sample. Moreover, the total number of reads for the 34 components of the mock sample differed by up to three orders of magnitude. However, 79 out of 86 of the unexpected OTUs were represented by <10 sequences that did not appear consistently across replicates. Our data suggest that random sampling of rare OTUs (e.g., small associated fauna such as parasites) accounted for most of variation in OTU presence-absence, whereas biases associated with indexed PCRs accounted for a larger amount of variation in relative abundance patterns. These results suggest that random sampling during sequencing leads to the low reproducibility of rare OTUs. We suggest that the strategy for handling rare OTUs should depend on the objectives of the study. Systematic removal of rare OTUs may avoid inflating diversity based on common ß descriptors but will exclude positive records of taxa that are functionally important. Our results further reinforce the need for technical replicates (parallel PCR and sequencing from the same sample) in metabarcoding experimental designs. Data reproducibility should be determined empirically as it will depend upon the sequencing depth, the type of sample, the sequence analysis pipeline, and the number of replicates. Moreover, estimating relative biomasses or abundances based on read counts remains elusive at the OTU level.","27","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","Indexed PCR primers | Multiplexing | Reproducibility","21100239256","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","856","2017","3",NA,"e3006",NA,NA,2017

In marine and estuarine benthic communities, the inventory and estimation of species richness are often hampered by the need for broad taxonomic expertise across several phyla. The use of DNA metabarcoding has emerged as a powerful tool for the fast assessment of species composition in a diversity of ecological communities. Here, we tested the amplification success of five primer sets targeting different COI-5P regions by 454 pyrosequencing to maximize the recovery of two simulated macrobenthic communities containing 21 species (SimCom1 and SimCom 2). Species identification was first performed against a compiled reference library of macrobenthic species. Reads with similarity results to reference sequences between 70% and 97% were then submitted to GenBank and BOLD to attempt the identification of concealed species in the bulk sample. The combination of at least three primer sets was able to recover more species than any primer set alone, achieving 85% of represented species in SimCom1 and 76% in SimCom2. Our approach was successful to detect low-frequency specimens, as well as concealed species, in the bulk sample, indicating the potential for the application of this approach on marine bioassessment and inventory, including the detection of ""hidden"" biodiversity that would hardly be possible based on morphology only.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Bioassessment | DNA barcoding | High-throughput sequencing | Marine macrobenthos","22211","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","857","60","3","28145743",NA,NA,NA,2017

Tropical rainforests harbor extraordinary biodiversity. The Amazon basin is thought to hold 30% of all river fish species in the world. Information about the ecology, reproduction, and recruitment of most species is still lacking, thus hampering fisheries management and successful conservation strategies. One of the key understudied issues in the study of population dynamics is recruitment. Fish larval ecology in tropical biomes is still in its infancy owing to identification difficulties. Molecular techniques are very promising tools for the identification of larvae at the species level. However, one of their limits is obtaining individual sequences with large samples of larvae. To facilitate this task, we developed a new method based on the massive parallel sequencing capability of next generation sequencing (NGS) coupled with hybridization capture. We focused on the mitochondrial marker cytochrome oxidase I (COI). The results obtained using the new method were compared with individual larval sequencing. We validated the ability of the method to identify Amazonian catfish larvae at the species level and to estimate the relative abundance of species in batches of larvae. Finally, we applied the method and provided evidence for strong temporal variation in reproductive activity of catfish species in the Ucayalí River in the Peruvian Amazon. This new time and cost effective method enables the acquisition of large datasets, paving the way for a finer understanding of reproductive dynamics and recruitment patterns of tropical fish species, with major implications for fisheries management and conservation.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","11",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","858","12","1","28095487","e0170009",NA,NA,2017

Previous metabarcoding work shows intertidal nematode communities were negatively affected by the oil spill. Here we examine the subsequent recovery of nematode community structure at five sites along the Alabama coast over a two-year period. The latter part of the study (July 2011–July 2012) also included an examination of nematode vertical distribution in intertidal sediments. Results showed nematode composition within this region was more influenced by sample locality than time and depth. The five sampling sites were characterized by distinct nematode assemblages that varied by sampling dates. Nematode diversity decreased four months after the oil spill but increased after one year, returning to previous levels at all sites except Bayfront Park (BP). There was no significant difference among nematode assemblages in reference to vertical distribution. Although the composition of nematode assemblages changed, the feeding guilds they represented were not significantly different even though some variation was noted. Data from morphological observations integrated with metabarcoding data indicated similar spatial variation in nematode distribution patterns, indicating the potential of using these faster approaches to examine overall disturbance impact trends within communities.

Background: Lake sediments harbor diverse microbial communities that cycle carbon and nutrients while being constantly colonized and potentially buried by organic matter sinking from the water column. The interaction of activity and burial remained largely unexplored in aquatic sediments. We aimed to relate taxonomic composition to sediment biogeochemical parameters, test whether community turnover with depth resulted from taxonomic replacement or from richness effects, and to provide a basic model for the vertical community structure in sediments. Methods: We analyzed four replicate sediment cores taken from 30-m depth in oligo-mesotrophic Lake Stechlin in northern Germany. Each 30-cm core spanned ca. 170 years of sediment accumulation according to 137Cs dating and was sectioned into layers 1-4 cm thick. We examined a full suite of biogeochemical parameters and used DNA metabarcoding to examine community composition of microbial Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota. Results: Community ß-diversity indicated nearly complete turnover within the uppermost 30 cm. We observed a pronounced shift from Eukaryota- and Bacteria-dominated upper layers (<5 cm) to Bacteria-dominated intermediate layers (5-14 cm) and to deep layers (>14 cm) dominated by enigmatic Archaea that typically occur in deep-sea sediments. Taxonomic replacement was the prevalent mechanism in structuring the community composition and was linked to parameters indicative of microbial activity (e.g., CO2 and CH4 concentration, bacterial protein production). Richness loss played a lesser role but was linked to conservative parameters (e.g., C, N, P) indicative of past conditions. Conclusions: By including all three domains, we were able to directly link the exponential decay of eukaryotes with the active sediment microbial community. The dominance of Archaea in deeper layers confirms earlier findings from marine systems and establishes freshwater sediments as a potential low-energy environment, similar to deep sea sediments. We propose a general model of sediment structure and function based on microbial characteristics and burial processes. An upper ""replacement horizon"" is dominated by rapid taxonomic turnover with depth, high microbial activity, and biotic interactions. A lower ""depauperate horizon"" is characterized by low taxonomic richness, more stable ""low-energy"" conditions, and a dominance of enigmatic Archaea.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Archaea | Bacteria | Beta diversity | Community | DNA metabarcoding | Eukaryota | Freshwater | Lake | Sediment | Turnover","21100401152","GR1540/15-1","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","1","TRUE","861","5","1","28388930","41",NA,NA,2017

While Symbiodinium communities did not differ between shores, metacommunity network analysis of host-symbiont associations revealed Symbiodinium lineages occupying `dominant' and `background' niches, and coral hosts that are more `flexible' or `specific' in their associations with Symbiodinium.

There is an urgent need to identify and understand the ecosystem services of pollination and seed dispersal provided by threatened mammals such as flying foxes. The first step towards this is to obtain comprehensive data on their diet. However, the volant and nocturnal nature of bats presents a particularly challenging situation, and conventional microhistological approaches to studying their diet can be laborious and timeconsuming, and provide incomplete information. We used Illumina Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) as a novel, non-invasive method for analysing the diet of the island flying fox (Pteropus hypomelanus) on Tioman Island, Peninsular Malaysia. Through DNA metabarcoding of plants in flying fox droppings, using primers targeting the rbcL gene, we identified at least 29 Operationally Taxonomic Units (OTUs) comprising the diet of this giant pteropodid. OTU sequences matched at least four genera and 14 plant families from online reference databases based on a conservative Least Common Ancestor approach, and eight species from our site-specific plant reference collection. NGS was just as successful as conventional microhistological analysis in detecting plant taxa from droppings, but also uncovered six additional plant taxa. The island flying fox's diet appeared to be dominated by figs (Ficus sp.), which was the most abundant plant taxon detected in the droppings every single month. Our study has shown that NGS can add value to the conventional microhistological approach in identifying food plant species from flying fox droppings. At this point in time, more accurate genusand species-level identification of OTUs not only requires support from databases with more representative sequences of relevant plant DNA, but probably necessitates in situ collection of plant specimens to create a reference collection. Although this method cannot be used to quantify true abundance or proportion of plant species, nor plant parts consumed, it ultimately provides a very important first step towards identifying plant taxa and spatio-temporal patterns in flying fox diets.","9","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Amplicon | Frugivory | Fruit bat | Metabarcoding | Nectarivory | Phytophagous | Pteropodid | RbcL","21100239256","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","864","2017","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Recent advances in molecular biological technologies have made it possible to detect and sequence DNA from environmental samples (environmental DNA or eDNA); however, eDNA techniques have not yet seen widespread adoption as a routine method for biological surveillance primarily due to gaps in our understanding of the dynamics of eDNA in space and time. In order to identify the effective spatial scale of this approach in a dynamic marine environment, we collected marine surface water samples from transects ranging from the intertidal zone to four kilometers from shore. Using PCR primers that target a diverse assemblage of metazoans, we amplified a region of mitochondrial 16S rDNA from the samples and sequenced the products on an Illumina platform in order to detect communities and quantify their spatial patterns using a variety of statistical tools. We find evidence for multiple, discrete eDNA communities in this habitat, and show that these communities decrease in similarity as they become further apart. Offshore communities tend to be richer but less even than those inshore, though diversity was not spatially autocorrelated. Taxon-specific relative abundance coincided with our expectations of spatial distribution in taxa lacking a microscopic, pelagic life-history stage, though most of the taxa detected do not meet these criteria. Finally, we use carefully replicated laboratory procedures to show that laboratory treatments were remarkably similar in most cases, while allowing us to detect a faulty replicate, emphasizing the importance of replication to metabarcoding studies. While there is much work to be done before eDNA techniques can be confidently deployed as a standard method for ecological monitoring, this study serves as a first analysis of diversity at the fine spatial scales relevant to marine ecologists and confirms the promise of eDNA in dynamic environments.","20","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Environmental monitoring | Estuarine | Marine | Metabarcoding | Metagenomics | Molecular ecology","21100239256","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","867","2017","2",NA,"e3044",NA,NA,2017

High-throughput DNA barcoding has become essential in ecology and evolution, but some technical questions still remain. Increasing the number of PCR cycles above the routine 20-30 cycles is a common practice when working with old-type specimens, which provide little amounts of DNA, or when facing annealing issues with the primers. However, increasing the number of cycles can raise the number of artificial mutations due to polymerase errors. In this work, we sequenced 20 COI libraries in the Illumina MiSeq platform. Libraries were prepared with 40, 45, 50, 55, and 60 PCR cycles from four individuals belonging to four species of four genera of cephalopods. We found no relationship between the number of PCR cycles and the number of mutations despite using a nonproofreading polymerase. Moreover, even when using a high number of PCR cycles, the resulting number of mutations was low enough not to be an issue in the context of high-throughput DNA barcoding (but may still remain an issue in DNA metabarcoding due to chimera formation). We conclude that the common practice of increasing the number of PCR cycles should not negatively impact the outcome of a high-throughput DNA barcoding study in terms of the occurrence of point mutations.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","COI | DNA barcoding | Illumina | Library | Mutations | Non-proofreading polymerase","22211","RYC-2009-03967","Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad","0","FALSE","872","60","10","28753409",NA,NA,NA,2017

We then calculated community completeness, an index showing the fraction of the species pool present, which is expected to reflect local processes. We found significant spatial variation, globally in species pool size, as well as in local and dark diversity (absent members of the species pool). Species pool size was larger close to areas containing tropical grasslands during the last glacial maximum, which are possible centres of diversification. Community completeness was greater in regions of high wilderness (remoteness from human disturbance). Local diversity was correlated with wilderness and current connectivity to mountain grasslands.

Background. Melissococcus plutonius is an entomopathogenic bacterium that causes European foulbrood (EFB), a honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) disease that necessitates quarantine in some countries. In Czechia, positive evidence of EFB was absent for almost 40 years, until an outbreak in the Krkonose Mountains National Park in 2015. This occurrence of EFB gave us the opportunity to study the epizootiology of EFB by focusing on the microbiome of honeybee workers, which act as vectors of honeybee diseases within and between colonies. Methods. The study included worker bees collected from brood combs of colonies (i) with no signs of EFB (EFB0), (ii) without clinical symptoms but located at an apiary showing clinical signs of EFB (EFB1), and (iii) with clinical symptoms of EFB (EFB2). In total, 49 samples from 27 honeybee colonies were included in the dataset evaluated in this study. Each biological sample consisted of 10 surface-sterilized worker bees processed for DNA extraction. All subjects were analyzed using conventional PCR and by metabarcoding analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene V1-V3 region, as performed through Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing. Results. The bees from EFB2 colonies with clinical symptoms exhibited a 75-fold-higher incidence of M. plutonius than those from EFB1 asymptomatic colonies. Melissococcus plutonius was identified in all EFB1 colonies as well as in some of the control colonies. The proportions of Fructobacillus fructosus, Lactobacillus kunkeei, Gilliamella apicola, Frischella perrara, and Bifidobacterium coryneforme were higher in EFB2 than in EFB1, whereas Lactobacillus mellis was significantly higher in EFB2 than in EFB0. Snodgrassella alvi and L. melliventris, L. helsingborgensis and, L. kullabergensis exhibited higher proportion in EFB1 than in EFB2 and EFB0. The occurrence of Bartonella apis and Commensalibacter intestini were higher in EFB0 than in EFB2 and EFB1. Enterococcus faecalis incidence was highest in EFB2. Conclusions. High-throughput Illumina sequencing permitted a semi-quantitative analysis of the presence of M. plutonius within the honeybee worker microbiome. The results of this study indicate that worker bees from EFB-diseased colonies are capable of transmitting M. plutonius due to the greatly increased incidence of the pathogen. The presence of M. plutonius sequences in control colonies supports the hypothesis that this pathogen exists in an enzootic state. The bacterial groups synergic to both the colonies with clinical signs of EFB and the EFB-asymptomatic colonies could be candidates for probiotics. This study confirms that E. faecalis is a secondary invader to M. plutonius; however, other putative secondary invaders were not identified in this study.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Bartonella apis | Enterococcus faecalis | Frischella perrara | Fructo-bacillus fructosus | Gilliamella apicola | Lactobacillus | Melissococcus plutonius | Microbiome | Pathogen detection | Snodgrassella alvi","21100239256","QJ1310085","Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China","1","TRUE","876","2017","9",NA,"3816",NA,NA,2017

The introduction and subsequent impact of Phytophthora cinnamomi within native vegetation is one of the major conservation issues for biodiversity in Australia. Recently, many new Phytophthora species have been described from Australia's native ecosystems; however, their distribution, origin, and potential impact remain unknown. Historical bias in Phytophthora detection has been towards sites showing symptoms of disease, and traditional isolation methods show variable effectiveness of detecting different Phytophthora species. However, we now have at our disposal new techniques based on the sampling of environmental DNA and metabarcoding through the use of high-throughput sequencing. Here, we report on the diversity and distribution of Phytophthora in Australia using metabarcoding of 640 soil samples and we compare the diversity detected using this technique with that available in curated databases. Phytophthora was detected in 65% of sites, and phylogenetic analysis revealed 68 distinct Phytophthora phylotypes. Of these, 21 were identified as potentially unique taxa and 25 were new detections in natural areas and/or new introductions to Australia. There are 66Phytophthora taxa listed in Australian databases, 43 of which were also detected in this metabarcoding study. This study revealed high Phytophthora richness within native vegetation and the additional records provide a valuable baseline resource for future studies.

Journal compilation  &  REABIC. Introduced Marine Pests (IMP, = non-indigenous marine species) prevention, early detection and risk-based management strategies have become the priority for biosecurity operations worldwide, in recognition of the fact that, once established, the effective management of marine pests can rapidly become cost prohibitive or impractical. In Western Australia (WA), biosecurity management is guided by the “Western Australian Prevention List for Introduced Marine Pests” which is a policy tool that details species or genera as being of high risk to the region. This list forms the basis of management efforts to prevent introduction of these species, monitoring efforts to detect them at an early stage, and rapid response should they be detected. It is therefore essential that the species listed can be rapid and confidently identified and discriminated from native species by a range of government and industry stakeholders. Recognising that identification of these species requires very specialist expertise which may be in short supply and not readily accessible in a regulatory environment, and the fact that much publicly available data is not verifiable or suitable for regulatory enforcement, the WA government commissioned the current project to collate a reference collection of these marine pest specimens. In this work, we thus established collaboration with researchers worldwide in order to source representative specimens of the species listed. Our main objective was to build a reference collection of taxonomically vouchered specimens and subsequently to generate species-specific DNA barcodes suited to supporting their future identification. To date, we were able to obtain specimens of 75 species (representative of all but four of the pests listed) which have been identified by experts and placed with the WA Government Department of Fisheries and, where possible, in accessible museums and institutions in Australasia. The reference collection supports the fast and reliable taxonomic and molecular identification of marine pests in WA and constitutes a valuable resource for training of stakeholders with interest in IMP recognition in Australia. The reference collection is also useful in supporting the development of a variety of DNA-based detection strategies such as real-time PCR and metabarcoding of complex environmental samples (e.g. biofouling communities). The Prevention List is under regular review to ensure its continued relevance and that it remains evidence and risk-based. Similarly, its associated reference collection also remains to some extent a work in progress. In recognition of this fact, this report seeks to provide details of this continually evolving information repository publicly available to the biosecurity management community worldwide.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","43","BoLD | COI | Cytochrome c oxidase I | Introduced Marine Pests (IMP) | Marine biosecurity | Taxonomic voucher | The Barcode of Life Data System","21100790931","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","880","8","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Working with the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding, we obtained DNA barcodes from recently collected and authoritatively identified specimens in the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) Insect Collection and the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge collection. We submitted tissues from 4776 specimens, of which 81% yielded DNA barcodes representing 1662 species and 1788 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs), of primarily terrestrial, large-bodied arthropods. This represents 84% of the species available for DNA barcoding in the UAM Insect Collection. There are now 4020 Alaskan arthropod species represented by DNA barcodes, after including all records in Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) of species that occur in Alaska-i.e., 48.5% of the 8277 Alaskan, non-marine-arthropod, named species have associated DNA barcodes. An assessment of the identification power of the library in its current state yielded fewer species-level identifications than expected, but the results were not discouraging. We believe we are the first to deliberately begin development of a DNA barcode library of the entire arthropod fauna for a North American state or province. Although far from complete, this library will become increasingly valuable as more species are added and costs to obtain DNA sequences fall.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Arthropoda | Biodiversity | DNA barcoding | Inventory | Monitoring","22211","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","882","60","3","28106469",NA,NA,NA,2017

Biological surveys are needed to monitor and assess the health of ecosystems and the species within them. However, morphology-based biodiversity surveys can be invasive, time consuming and financially expensive. Recently, environmental (e)DNA sequencing has been demonstrated as a potential alternative to morphological-based surveys because it enables the rapid and inexpensive detection of multiple taxa from DNA present in the environment. Numerous studies have shown that eDNA-based biodiversity surveys can provide considerable information about aquatic ecosystem function and health. Therefore, this molecular method has the potential to improve how current aquatic biological surveys are conducted. Currently, most eDNA literature is aimed at an audience with a moderate to advanced knowledge of DNA sequencing, creating a barrier for many ecologists who lack DNA sequencing expertise but wish to apply such methods to their research. The aim of this review is to provide guidance to non-geneticists regarding sequencing eDNA for aquatic biodiversity surveys and to highlight the requirements that need to be considered before the technique can be effectively incorporated into biomonitoring programs. Specifically, we provide details and recommendations on some of the major principles, from sample collection to bioinformatic analyses. For those areas where specific recommendations cannot be given, we have provided references to suitable literature.","8","Journal","re","Review","100","3","metabarcoding | metagenomics | methods | monitoring | NGS | summary.","27846","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","883","68","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

The Arctic treeline ecotone is characterised by a steep vegetation gradient from arctic tundra to northern taiga forests, which is thought to influence the water chemistry of thermokarst lakes in this region. Environmentally sensitive diatoms respond to such ecological changes in terms of variation in diatom diversity and richness, which so far has only been documented by microscopic surveys. We applied next-generation sequencing to analyse the diatom composition of lake sediment DNA extracted from 32 lakes across the treeline in the Khatanga region, Siberia, using a short fragment of the rbcL chloroplast gene as a genetic barcode. We compared diatom richness and diversity obtained from the genetic approach with diatom counts from traditional microscopic analysis. Both datasets were employed to investigate diversity and relationships with environmental variables, using ordination methods. After effective filtering of the raw data, the two methods gave similar results for diatom richness and composition at the genus level (DNA 12 taxa; morphology 19 taxa), even though there was a much higher absolute number of sequences obtained per genetic sample (median 50,278), compared with microscopic counts (median 426). Dissolved organic carbon explained the highest percentage of variance in both datasets (14.2 % DNA; 18.7 % morphology), reflecting the compositional turnover of diatom assemblages along the tundra-taiga transition. Differences between the two approaches are mostly a consequence of the filtering process of genetic data and limitations of genetic references in the database, which restricted the determination of genetically identified sequence types to the genus level. The morphological approach, however, allowed identifications mostly to species level, which permits better ecological interpretation of the diatom data. Nevertheless, because of a rapidly increasing reference database, the genetic approach with sediment DNA will, in the future, enable reliable investigations of diatom composition from lake sediments that will have potential applications in both paleoecology and environmental monitoring.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Arctic thermokarst lakes | Diatoms | Environmental DNA | Lake sediments | Metabarcoding | Treeline ecotone","13937","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","886","57","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Methods in Ecology and Evolution © 2016 British Ecological Society Molecular analysis of predator gut content is a popular tool to uncover food web structure and has greatly profited from the emergence of next-generation sequencing technology. However, the molecular recovery of prey spectra comes with many challenges, particularly the overabundance of predator DNA in extractions. When predator and prey are distantly related, predator-specific blocking primers can be used to preferentially amplify prey DNA. But this is difficult in the case of arthropods, where prey and predator are often closely related. Here, we present a simple and cost-efficient protocol for high-throughput analysis of the gut content of predatory arthropods without the need for blocking primers. We test several factors for their potential to enrich prey DNA from extractions of predators, including size selection of DNA, selection of different body parts for extraction, and variation in extraction lysis time and PCR fragment length. Using a locally abundant spider species (Hololena adnexa, Agelenidae), we show that prey DNA can be significantly enriched from predator extracts by selectively removing high molecular weight DNA and by extracting from the midgut and hindgut only. A comparison of our results with observational data from other agelenid spider species indicates a high efficiency of our approach. Our enrichment protocol allows for the parallel analysis of several hundred predators in a single MiSeq run, reducing the cost per specimen to only a few dollars and requiring a simple and minimal work flow. This will enable large-scale and ecosystem-wide analyses of niche differentiation and food web structure.","15","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","foods webs | gut content analysis | metabarcoding | next-generation sequencing | species interactions","21100217611","DEB 1241253","National Science Foundation","1","TRUE","887","8","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017

Background: Triatomine bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) are vectors of the flagellate Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The study of triatomine gut microbiota has gained relevance in the last years due to its possible role in vector competence and prospective use in control strategies. The objective of this study is to examine changes in the gut microbiota composition of triatomines in response to a T. cruzi-infected blood meal and identifying key factors determining those changes. Results: We sampled colony-reared individuals from six triatomine vectors (Panstrongylus megistus, Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma brasiliensis, T. infestans, T. juazeirensis and T. sherlocki) comparing experimentally T. cruzi strain 0354-challenged and non-challenged insects. The microbiota of gut and gonad tissues was characterized using high throughput sequencing of region V3-V4 of bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The triatomine microbiota had a low intra-individual diversity, and a high inter-individual variation within the same host species. Arsenophonous appeared as the dominant triatomine bacterial symbiont in our study (59% of the total 16S coverage), but there were significant differences in the distribution of bacterial genera among vectors. In Rhodnius prolixus the dominant symbiont was Pectobacterium. Conclusions: Trypanosoma cruzi-challenge significantly affects microbiota composition, with challenged vectors harbouring a significantly more diverse bacterial community, both in the gut and the gonads. Our results show that blood-feeding with T. cruzi epimastigotes strongly affects microbiota composition in a species-specific manner. We suggest that triatomine-adapted enterobacteria such as Arsenophonus could be used as stable vectors for genetic transformation of triatomine bugs and control of Chagas disease.","12","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","16 rRNA | Arsenophonus | Chagas disease | Metabarcoding | Microbiota | Triatomine bugs | Trypanosoma cruzi","17500154721","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","889","9","1","27938415","636",NA,NA,2016

Functional Ecology © 2016 British Ecological Society Significant advances in both mathematical and molecular approaches in ecology offer unprecedented opportunities to describe and understand ecosystem functioning. Ecological networks describe interactions between species, the underlying structure of communities and the function and stability of ecosystems. They provide the ability to assess the robustness of complex ecological communities to species loss, as well as a novel way of guiding restoration. However, empirically quantifying the interactions between entire communities remains a significant challenge. Concomitantly, advances in DNA sequencing technologies are resolving previously intractable questions in functional and taxonomic biodiversity and provide enormous potential to determine hitherto difficult to observe species interactions. Combining DNA metabarcoding approaches with ecological network analysis presents important new opportunities for understanding large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes, as well as providing powerful tools for building ecosystems that are resilient to environmental change. We propose a novel ‘nested tagging’ metabarcoding approach for the rapid construction of large, phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks. Taking tree–insect–parasitoid ecological networks as an illustration, we show how measures of network robustness, constructed using DNA metabarcoding, can be used to determine the consequences of tree species loss within forests, and forest habitat loss within wider landscapes. By determining which species and habitats are important to network integrity, we propose new directions for forest management. Merging metabarcoding with ecological network analysis provides a revolutionary opportunity to construct some of the largest, phylogenetically structured species-interaction networks to date, providing new ways to: (i) monitor biodiversity and ecosystem functioning; (ii) assess the robustness of interacting communities to species loss; and (iii) build ecosystems that are more resilient to environmental change.

These included the pelagic and littoral water column, sediments, and biotic substrates. We performed high throughput sequencing using the Roche 454 platform, employing a universal eukaryotic marker region within the large ribosomal subunit (LSU) to compare fungal diversity, community structure, and species turnover among habitats.

Richness estimates were highest in the sediment, biofilms, and benthic samples (189-231 OTUs), intermediate in water samples (42-85 OTUs), and lowest in plankton samples (8 OTUs). NMDS grouped the eight studied habitats into six clusters, indicating that community composition was strongly influenced by turnover among habitats. Fungal communities exhibited changes at the phylum and order levels along three different substrate categories from littoral to pelagic habitats. The large majority of OTUs (> 75%) could not be classified below the order level due to the lack of aquatic fungal entries in public sequence databases.

Across 136 analysed soil samples collected from Mount Menzies, Mawson Escarpment and Lake Terrasovoje, we found invertebrate distribution in the Prince Charles Mountains significantly influenced by soil salinity and/or sulfur content. Phyla Tardigrada and Arachnida occurred predominantly in low-salinity substrates with abundant nutrients, whereas Bdelloidea (Rotifera) and Chromadorea (Nematoda) were more common in highly saline substrates. A significant correlation between invertebrate occurrence, soil salinity and time since deglaciation indicates that terrain age indirectly influences Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity, with more recently deglaciated areas supporting greater diversity.

Remarkably, diversity of this clade inferred from metabarcoding data surpasses even that of dinoflagellates, metazoans, and rhizarians, qualifying diplonemids as possibly the most diverse group of marine planktonic eukaryotes. Diplonemids display strong vertical separation between the photic and mesopelagic layers, with the majority of their relative abundance and diversity occurring in deeper waters. Globally, diplonemids display no apparent biogeographic structuring, with a few hyperabundant cosmopolitan operational taxonomic units (OTUs) dominating their communities. Our results suggest that the planktonic diplonemids are among the key heterotrophic players in the largest ecosystem of our biosphere, yet their roles in this ecosystem remain unknown.","29","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","cosmopolitan | diplonemids | diversity | metabarcoding | plankton | Tara Oceans","15537","GBMF4983","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation","1","TRUE","896","26","22","27875689",NA,NA,"S096098221631082X",2016

Background The diversity of organisms is being commonly accessed using metabarcoding of environmental samples. Reliable identification of barcodes is one of the critical steps in the process and several taxonomy assignment methods were proposed to accomplish this task, including alignment-based approach that uses Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm. This publication evaluates the variability of 5' end of 18S rRNA barcoding region as expressed by similarity scores (alignment score and identity score) produced by BLAST, and its impact on barcode identification to family-level taxonomic categories.

Since various taxa show different level of genetic variation, practical application of alignment-based approach requires the determination and use of taxon-specific similarity thresholds.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","1","18S rRNA | Alignmentbased approach | BLAST | Metabarcoding | Nematoda | OTU | Taxonomy assignment","21100808899","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","897","4","1",NA,"e10647",NA,NA,2016

The aim of the present study is to deepen the current understanding of the microbial communities at two poplar phytomanagement sites to reveal the environmental factors that drive the abundance, diversity and composition of microbial communities. A soil analysis revealed that the two soils displayed contrasting physico-chemical characteristics, with significant lower pH and higher Cd, Zn and Mn CaCl2-extractable fractions at Leforest site, compared with Pierrelaye site. The fungal and bacterial community profiles in the poplar roots and soils were assessed through Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Diversity indices and ß-diversity measures illustrated that the root microbial communities were well separated from the soil microbial communities at both sites. A detailed study of the fungal composition showed that Ascomycota dominated the overall fungal communities on poplar soil, the root samples at Pierrelaye, and the unplanted soil at the experimental sites. Conversely, Basidiomycota accounted for a much higher percentage of the fungal community in poplar root samples from the Leforest site. The root bacterial communities were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and the soil samples were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria. The occurrence and dominance of the ectomycorrhizal community at Leforest but not at Pierrelaye is the major feature of our data set. Overall, ectomycorrhizal root symbionts appeared to be highly constrained by soil characteristics at the phytomanagement sites. Our data support the view that mycorrhizal inoculation is needed in highly stressed and nutrient-poor environments.","10","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Bacterial 16S | Fungal ITS | Illumina MiSeq sequencing | Phytomanagement | Poplar plantation | Trace element","25349","13/070-203-2015","Conseil Régional de Franche-Comté","0","FALSE","898","571",NA,"27474992",NA,"ADEME","S0048969716316035",2016

Nutrient amendment of mesocosms promoted the development of haptophyte (Phaeocystis pouchetii)- and diatom (Skeletonema marinoi)-dominated plankton communities in mesocosms, in which Calanus sp. copepods were incubated for 24 h in flow-through chambers to allow access to prey particles (<500 µm).

Taxon-specific metabarcoding ratios (ratio of consumed prey to available prey in the surrounding seawater) revealed diverse and dynamic copepod feeding selection, with positive selection on large diatoms, heterotrophic nanoflagellates and fungi, while smaller phytoplankton, including P. pouchetii, were passively consumed or even negatively selected according to our indicator. Our analysis of the relationship between Calanus grazing ratios and intracellular metabolite profiles indicates the importance of carbohydrates and lipids in plankton succession and copepod–prey interactions.

Freshwater habitats are of high conservation value and provide a wide range of ecosystem services. Effective management requires regular monitoring. However, conventional methods based on direct observation or specimen collection are so invasive, expensive and labour-intensive that frequent monitoring is uncommon. Here, we test whether the evaluation of environmental DNA (eDNA) from water based on a simple protocol can be used for assessing biodiversity. We use universal metazoan primers for characterizing water eDNA across horizontal and vertical spatial dimensions in two reservoirs with known species diversity for two key taxa. eDNA obtained directly from 42 samples × 15 ml water (total = 630 ml) per reservoir yielded DNA signatures for more than 500 metazoan species, of which 105 could be identified to species/genus based on DNA barcodes. We show that eDNA can be used to assign each water sample to its reservoir of origin, and that eDNA outperforms conventional survey methods in single-sample richness comparisons, while revealing evidence for hundreds of unknown species that are undetected by conventional bioassessment methods. eDNA also confirms the presence of a recently discovered invasive snail species and provides evidence for the continued survival of a rare native species of goby not 2 sighted in that habitat since 2007. eDNA thus promises to be a useful addition to the bioassessment toolbox for freshwater systems.","13","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","EDNA | Freshwater bioassessment | Metabarcoding","21100446014","R-154-000-648-646","National University of Singapore","1","TRUE","900","3","11",NA,"160635",NA,NA,2016

However, direct observation of diet can be difficult, particularly for small, nocturnal animals such as the Pacific pocket mouse (Heteromyidae: Perognathus longimembris pacificus). Very little is known of the dietary habits of this federally endangered rodent, hindering management and restoration efforts. We used a metabarcoding approach to identify source plants in fecal samples (N = 52) from the three remaining populations known. The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal loci were sequenced following the Illumina MiSeq amplicon strategy and processed reads were mapped to reference databases. We evaluated a range of threshold mapping criteria and found the best-performing setting generally recovered two distinct mock communities in proportions similar to expectation. We tested our method on captive animals fed a known diet and recovered almost all plant sources, but found substantial heterogeneity among fecal pellets collected from the same individual at the same time. Observed richness did not increase with pooling of pellets from the same individual. In field-collected samples, we identified 4-14 plant genera in individual samples and 74 genera overall, but over 50 percent of reads mapped to just six species in five genera. We simulated the effects of sequencing error, variable read length, and chimera formation to infer taxon-specific rates of misassignment for the local flora, which were generally low with some exceptions. Richness at the species and genus levels did not reach a clear asymptote, suggesting that diet breadth remained underestimated in the current pool of samples. Large numbers of scat samples are therefore needed to make inferences about diet and resource selection in future studies of the Pacific pocket mouse. We conclude that our minimally invasive method is promising for determining herbivore diets given a library of sequences from local plants.","6","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","901","11","11","27851756","e0165366",NA,NA,2016

Two new PCR primer sets targeting the V4-V5 and V5-V7 variable regions of the ribosomal 18S RNA (18S rRNA) were designed to be specific for metazoans metabarcoding and capable of detecting the majority of their lineages.

However, it can be difficult to execute robust morphological identification of fish bones from species-rich fossil assemblages, especially from post-cranial material with few distinguishing features. Fragmentation, weathering and burning further impede taxonomic identification, resulting in large numbers of unidentifiable bones from archaeological sites. This limitation can be somewhat mitigated by taking an ancient DNA (aDNA) bulk-bone metabarcoding (BBM) approach to faunal identification, where DNA from non-diagnostic bone fragments is extracted and sequenced in parallel. However, a large proportion of fishing communities (both past and present) live in tropical regions that have sub-optimal conditions for long-term aDNA preservation. To date, the BBM method has never been applied to fish bones before, or to fossils excavated from an exposed context within a tropical climate. Here, we demonstrate that morphologically indistinct bulk fish bone from the tropics can be identified by sequencing aDNA extracted from 100 to 300 ya archaeological midden material in southwest Madagascar. Despite the biases of the approach, we rapidly obtained family, genus, and species-level assemblage information, and used this to describe a subset of the ichthyofauna exploited by an 18th century fishing community. We identified 23 families of fish, including benthic, pelagic, and coral-dwelling fishes, suggesting a reliance on a variety of marine and brackish habitats. When possible, BBM should be used alongside osteological approaches to address the limitations of both; however, this study highlights how genetic methods can nevertheless be a valuable tool for helping resolve faunal assemblages when morphological identification is hindered by taphonomic processes, lack of adequate comparative collections, and time constraints, and can provide a temporal perspective on fish biodiversity in the context of accelerated exploitation of the marine environment.","12","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Ancient DNA | Archaeology | Biodiversity | Bulk-bone | Fish | Madagascar | Metabarcoding | Subsistence","31405","DP160104473","Yale University","0","FALSE","903","75",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0305440316301467",2016

Mycelium biomass of L. vinosus was significantly greater in the freeze-dried soil samples than in samples dried at oven and room temperature. However, drying procedures had no effect on fungal community composition or on fungal diversity. In addition, there were no significant differences in the proportions of fungi according to their functional roles (moulds vs. mycorrhizal species) in response to drying procedures. Only six out of 1139 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) had increased their relative proportions after soil drying at room temperature, with five of these OTUs classified as mould or yeast species. However, the magnitude of these changes was small, with an overall increase in relative abundance of these OTUs of approximately 2 %. These results suggest that DNA degradation may occur especially after drying soil samples at room temperature, but affecting equally nearly all fungi and therefore causing no significant differences in diversity and community composition.

Phyllosphere fungi harbor a tremendous species diversity and play important ecological roles. However, little is known about their distribution patterns within forest ecosystems. We examined how species diversity and community composition of phyllosphere fungi change along a vertical structure in a tropical forest in Thailand. Fungal communities in 144 leaf samples from 19 vertical layers (1.28-34.4 m above ground) of 73 plant individuals (27 species) were investigated by metabarcoding analysis using Ion Torrent sequencing. In total, 1,524 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected among 890,710 reads obtained from the 144 leaf samples. Taxonomically diverse fungi belonging to as many as 24 orders of Ascomycota and 21 orders of Basidiomycota were detected, most of which inhabited limited parts of the lowest layers closest to the forest floor. Species diversity of phyllosphere fungi was the highest in the lowest layers closest to the forest floor, decreased with increasing height, and lowest in the canopy; 742 and 55 fungal OTUs were detected at the lowest and highest layer, respectively. On the layers close to the forest floor, phyllosphere fungal communities were mainly composed of low frequency OTUs and largely differentiated among plant individuals. Conversely, in the canopy, fungal communities consisted of similar OTUs across plant individuals, and as many as 86.1%-92.7% of the OTUs found in the canopy (=22 m above ground) were also distributed in the lower layers.

Remote polar and deepwater fish faunas are under pressure from ongoing climate change and increasing fishing effort. However, these fish communities are difficult to monitor for logistic and financial reasons. Currently, monitoring of marine fishes largely relies on invasive techniques such as bottom trawling, and on official reporting of global catches, which can be unreliable. Thus, there is need for alternative and non-invasive techniques for qualitative and quantitative oceanic fish surveys. Here we report environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of seawater samples from continental slope depths in Southwest Greenland. We collected seawater samples at depths of 188±918 m and compared seawater eDNA to catch data from trawling. We used Illumina sequencing of PCR products to demonstrate that eDNA reads show equivalence to fishing catch data obtained from trawling. Twenty-six families were found with both trawling and eDNA, while three families were found only with eDNA and two families were found only with trawling. Key commercial fish species for Greenland were the most abundant species in both eDNA reads and biomass catch, and interpolation of eDNA abundances between sampling sites showed good correspondence with catch sizes. Environmental DNA sequence reads from the fish assemblages correlated with biomass and abundance data obtained from trawling. Interestingly, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) showed high abundance of eDNA reads despite only a single specimen being caught, demonstrating the relevance of the eDNA approach for large species that can probably avoid bottom trawls in most cases. Quantitative detection of marine fish using eDNA remains to be tested further to ascertain whether this technique is able to yield credible results for routine application in fisheries. Nevertheless, our study demonstrates that eDNA reads can be used as a qualitative and quantitative proxy for marine fish assemblages in deepwater oceanic habitats. This relates directly to applied fisheries as well as to monitoring effects of ongoing climate change on marine biodiversity-especially in polar ecosystems.","48","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","907","11","11","27851757","e0165252",NA,NA,2016

The major disadvantage of both techniques is their inability to use advanced digested material. This study introduces next-generation sequencing to lionfish feeding ecology, employing DNA metabarcoding to analyze all components of the gut contents, including the previously unidentifiable portion. Sixty-three lionfish were caught from the inshore and offshore reefs of La Parguera, Puerto Rico.

The ability to detect non-indigenous species (NIS), particularly those present at low abundance, is limited by difficulties in performing exhaustive sampling and in identifying species. Here we sample zooplankton from 16 major Canadian ports and apply a metabarcoding approach to detect NIS. Location: Marine and freshwater ports along Canadian coastlines (Pacific, Arctic, Atlantic) and the Great Lakes. Methods: We amplified the V4 region of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S) and used two distinct analytic protocols to identify species present at low abundance. Taxonomic assignment was conducted using BLAST searches against a local 18S sequence database of either (i) individual reads (totalling 7,733,541 reads) or (ii) operational taxonomic units (OTUs) generated by sequence clustering. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to confirm the identity of reads with ambiguous taxonomic assignment. Results: Taxonomic assignment of individual reads identified 379 zooplankton species at a minimum sequence identity of 97%. Of these, 24 species were identified as NIS, 11 of which were detected in previously unreported locations. When reads were clustered into OTUs prior to taxonomic assignment, six NIS were no longer detected and an additional NIS was falsely identified. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that sequences belonging to closely related species clustered together into shared OTUs as a result of low interspecific variation. NIS can thus be misidentified when their sequences join the OTUs of more abundant native species. Main conclusions: Our results reveal the power of the metabarcoding approach, whilst also highlighting the need to account for potentially low levels of genetic diversity when processing data, to use barcode markers that allow differentiation of closely related species and to continue building comprehensive sequence databases that allow reliable and fine-scale taxonomic designation.","18","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","18S | biodiversity | biomonitoring | high-throughput sequencing | invasive species | metabarcoding | operational taxonomic unit","14551","100-talent","Canada Research Chairs","0","FALSE","912","22","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

Over the past 50 years, Tropical East Asia has lost more biodiversity than any tropical region. Tropical East Asia is a megadiverse region with an acute taxonomic impediment.

We reviewed DNA barcoding efforts in Tropical East Asia relative to other tropical regions. We suggest DNA barcodes (or metabarcodes from next-generation sequencers) may be especially useful for characterizing and connecting species-level biodiversity units in inventories encompassing taxa lacking formal description (particularly arthropods) and in large-scale, minimal-impact approaches to vertebrate monitoring and population assessments through secondary sources of DNA (invertebrate derived DNA and environmental DNA).

The removal of aged hydrophobic contaminants from fine-textured soils is a challenging issue in remediation. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of augmentation treatments to that of biostimulation in terms of total aliphatic hydrocarbon (TAH) and toxicity removal from a historically contaminated clay soil and to assess their impact on the resident microbial community. To this aim, Pleurotus ostreatus, Botryosphaeria rhodina and a combination of both were used as the inoculants while the addition of a sterilized lignocellulose mixture to soil (1:5, w/w) was used as a biostimulation approach. As opposed to the non-amended control soil, where no changes in TAH concentration and residual toxicity were observed after 60 days, the activation of specialized bacteria was found in the biostimulated microcosms resulting in significant TAH removal (79.8%). The bacterial community structure in B. rhodina-augmented microcosms did not differ from the biostimulated microcosms due to the inability of the fungus to be retained within the resident microbiota. Best TAH removals were observed in microcosms inoculated with P. ostreatus alone (Po) and in binary consortium with B. rhodina (BC) (86.8 and 88.2%, respectively). In these microcosms, contaminant degradation exceeded their bioavailability thresholds determined by sequential supercritical CO2 extraction. Illumina metabarcoding of 16S rRNA gene showed that the augmentation with Po and BC led to lower relative abundances of Gram(+) taxa, Actinobacteria in particular, than those in biostimulated microcosms. Best detoxification, with respect to the non-amended incubation control, was found in Po microcosms where a drop in collembola mortality (from 90 to 22%) occurred. At the end of incubation, in both Po and BC, the relative abundances of P. ostreatus sequences were higher than 60% thus showing the suitability of this fungus in bioaugmentation-based remediation applications.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Bioremediation | Contaminant bioavailability | High-throughput sequencing | Microbial community | Oil-contaminated soil | Pleurotus ostreatus","25349","15-02328S","Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society","0","FALSE","916","566-567",NA,"27220102",NA,NA,"S0048969716309238",2016

Bolidomonas is a genus of picoplanktonic flagellated algae that is closely related to diatoms. Triparma laevis, a species belonging to the Parmales, which are small cells with a siliceous covering, has been shown to form a monophyletic group with Bolidomonas. We isolated several novel strains of Bolidophyceae that have permitted further exploration of the diversity of this group using nuclear, plastidial and mitochondrial genes. The resulting phylogenetic data led us to formally emend the taxonomy of this group to include the Parmales within the Bolidophyceae, to combine Bolidomonas within Triparma and to define a novel species, Triparma eleuthera sp. nov. The global distribution of Bolidophyceae was then assessed using environmental sequences available in public databases, as well as a large 18S rRNA V9 metabarcode data set from the Tara Oceans expedition. Bolidophyceans appear ubiquitous throughout the sampled oceans but always constitute a minor component of the phytoplankton community, corresponding to at most ~4% of the metabarcodes from photosynthetic groups (excluding dinoflagellates). They are ~10 times more abundant in the small size fraction (0.8-5 µm) than in larger size fractions. T. eleuthera sp. nov. constitutes the most abundant and most widespread operational taxonomic unit (OTU) followed by T. pacifica, T. mediterranea and the T. laevis clade.

The hugely successful Linnaean project is unlikely to be extensible to the totality of approximately 10 million species in a reasonable time frame and thus alternative toolkits and methodologies need to be developed. One such toolkit is DNA barcoding, particularly in its metabarcoding or metagenetics mode, where organisms are identified purely by the presence of a diagnosticDNA sequence in samples that are not processed for morphological identification.

DNA barcoding and metabarcoding methods have been invaluable in the study of interactions between host organisms and their symbiotic communities. Barcodes can help identify individual symbionts that are difficult to distinguish using morphological characters, and provide a way to classify undescribed species. Entire symbiont communities can be characterized rapidly using barcoding and especially metabarcoding methods, which is often crucial for isolating ecological signal from the substantial variation among individual hosts. Furthermore, barcodes allow the evolutionary histories of symbionts and their hosts to be assessed simultaneously and in reference to one another. Here, we describe three projects illustrating the utility of barcodes for studying symbiotic interactions: first, we consider communities of arthropods found in the ant-occupied domatia of the East African ant-plant Vachellia (Acacia) drepanolobium; second, we examine communities of arthropod and protozoan inquilines in three species of Nepenthes pitcher plant in South East Asia; third, we investigate communities of gut bacteria of South American ants in the genus Cephalotes.

Encompassing the breadth of biodiversity in biomonitoring programmes has been frustrated by an inability to simultaneously identify large numbers of species accurately and in a timely fashion. Biomonitoring infers the state of an ecosystem from samples collected and identified using the best available taxonomic knowledge. The advent of DNA barcoding has now given way to the extraction of bulk DNA from mixed samples of organisms in environmental samples through the development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS). This DNA metabarcoding approach allows an unprecedented view of the true breadth and depth of biodiversity, but its adoption poses two important challenges. First, bioinformatics techniques must simultaneously perform complex analyses of large datasets and translate the results of these analyses to a range of users. Second, the insights gained from HTS need to be amalgamated with concepts such as Linnaean taxonomy and indicator species, which are less comprehensive but more intuitive. It is clear that we are moving beyond proof-of-concept studies to address the challenge of implementation of this new approach for environmental monitoring and regulation.

Moreover, a large majority of these are small (less than 1 mm), cryptic and still unknown to science. However, this knowledge gap, caused by the lack of diagnostic morphological features in small organisms and the limited sampling of the global ocean, is currently being filled, thanks to new DNA-based approaches. The molecular technique of PCR amplification of homologous gene regions combined with highthroughput sequencing, routinely used to census unculturable prokaryotes, is now also being used to characterize whole communities of marine eukaryotes.

In particular,we argue that 18S variable regions do not provide sufficient taxonomic resolution to census marine life, and suggest combining broad eukaryotic surveys targeting the 18S rRNA region with more taxon-focused analyses of hypervariable regions to improve our understanding of the diversity of species, the functional units of marine ecosystems.","34","Journal","re","Review","100","2","18S | Meiofauna | Metabarcoding | Plankton | Protist","13602","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","921","371","1702","27481783","20150331",NA,NA,2016

The challenge of documenting and describing fungal diversity is exacerbated by their typically cryptic nature, their ability to produce seemingly unrelated morphologies from a single individual and their similarity in appearance to distantly related taxa. This multiplicity of hurdles resulted in the early adoption of DNA-based comparisons to study fungal diversity, including linking curated DNA sequence data to expertly identified voucher specimens. DNA-barcoding approaches in fungi were first applied in specimen-based studies for identification and discovery of taxonomic diversity, but are now widely deployed for community characterization based on sequencing of environmental samples. Collectively, fungal barcoding approaches have yielded important advances across biological scales and research applications, from taxonomic, ecological, industrial and health perspectives. A major outstanding issue is the growing problem of ‘sequences without names’ that are somewhat uncoupled from the traditional framework of fungal classification based on morphology and preserved specimens. This review summarizes some of the most significant impacts of fungal barcoding, its limitations, and progress towards the challenge of effective utilization of the exponentially growing volume of data gathered from high-throughput sequencing technologies.","29","Journal","re","Review","100","3","Barcoding | Diversity | Fungi | Internal transcribed spacer | Metabarcoding | Taxonomy","13602","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","922","371","1702","27481788","20150336",NA,NA,2016

It is important to monitor such areas in order to detect, understand and remediate environmental responses to stressors. The natural heterogeneity and complexity of communities means that accurate monitoring requires high resolution, both temporally and spatially, as well as more complete assessments of taxa. Increased resolution and taxonomic coverage is economically challenging using current microscopy-based monitoring practices. Alternatively, DNA sequencing-based methods have been suggested for cost-efficient monitoring, offering additional insights into ecosystem function and disturbance. Here, we applied DNA metabarcoding of eukaryotic communities in marine sediments, in areas of offshore drilling on the Norwegian continental shelf. Forty-five samples, collected from seven drilling sites in the Troll/Oseberg region, were assessed, using the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene as a taxonomic marker. In agreement with results based on classical morphology-based monitoring, we were able to identify changes in sediment communities surrounding oil platforms. In addition to overall changes in community structure, we identified several potential indicator taxa, responding to pollutants associated with drilling fluids. These included the metazoan orders Macrodasyida, Macrostomida and Ceriantharia, as well as several ciliates and other protist taxa, typically not targeted by environmental monitoring programmes.

We propose a flotation–Berlese–flotation (FBF) protocol for sampling and specimen processing to obtain ‘clean’ DNA extractions of arthropod mesofauna from the soil. In addition, we developed and tested HTS protocols for the characterisation of arthropod communities from these bulk DNA extractions using cox1 metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomic sequencing on the MiSeq Illumina platform. The FBF protocol provided DNA of soil arthropods from sufficiently large volumes of soil and free from contaminating bacteria and inhibitors. Metabarcoding and metagenomic sequencing on two deep soil samples from Iberian grasslands revealed >100 species of Acari and Collembola from 28 families. Genome assembly straight from shotgun sequencing of bulk specimens produced partial and full mitogenomes for 54 species with average length of >6000 bp. Metabarcoding and metagenomic sequencing resulted in closely congruent OTUs, but species numbers were highest with metabarcoding, while ~73% of species were confirmed by matching shotgun sequence reads and ~48% by contig assembly from those shotgun reads. In combination, the FBF protocol together with the PCR-based and shotgun sequencing pipelines addressed most of the challenges of studying soil arthropod mesofauna on the MiSeq Illumina platform. They are powerful, cost-efficient tools for characterising soil diversity in a phylogenetic and community ecology context. These methodological developments of HTS approaches for the study of mesofauna will accelerate ecological and evolutionary studies, biomonitoring of soil arthropods, and progress in both theoretical and applied soil science.","14","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Acari | biomonitoring | Collembola | community structure | deep soil | high-throughput sequencing | mesofauna extraction | metagenome skimming | phylodiversity | soil biodiversity","21100217611","NE/L013134/1","Comisión Sectorial de Investigación Científica","1","TRUE","926","7","9",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

Recent studies have advocated biomonitoring using DNA techniques. In this study, two high-throughput sequencing (HTS)-based methods were evaluated: amplicon metabarcoding of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial gene and gene enrichment using MYbaits (targeting nine different genes including COI). The gene-enrichment method does not require PCR amplification and thus avoids biases associated with universal primers. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected from 12 New Zealand rivers. Macroinvertebrates were morphologically identified and enumerated, and their biomass determined. DNA was extracted from all macroinvertebrate samples and HTS undertaken using the illumina miseq platform. Macroinvertebrate communities were characterized from sequence data using either six genes (three of the original nine were not used) or just the COI gene in isolation. The gene-enrichment method (all genes) detected the highest number of taxa and obtained the strongest Spearman rank correlations between the number of sequence reads, abundance and biomass in 67% of the samples. Median detection rates across rare (<1% of the total abundance or biomass), moderately abundant (1-5%) and highly abundant (>5%) taxa were highest using the gene-enrichment method (all genes). Our data indicated primer biases occurred during amplicon metabarcoding with greater than 80% of sequence reads originating from one taxon in several samples. The accuracy and sensitivity of both HTS methods would be improved with more comprehensive reference sequence databases. The data from this study illustrate the challenges of using PCR amplification-based methods for biomonitoring and highlight the potential benefits of using approaches, such as gene enrichment, which circumvent the need for an initial PCR step.","39","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","biomonitoring | gene enrichment | high-throughput sequencing | macroinvertebrates | metabarcoding","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","927","16","5","26583904",NA,NA,NA,2016

Nowadays, our knowledge of the fungal biodiversity in fermented vegetables is limited although these microorganisms could have a great influence on the quality and safety of this kind of food. This work uses a metagenetic approach to obtain basic knowledge of the fungal community ecology during the course of fermentation of natural Aloreña de Málaga table olives, from reception of raw material to edible fruits. For this purpose, samples of brines and fruits were collected from two industries in Guadalhorce Valley (Málaga, Spain) at different moments of fermentation (0, 7, 30 and 120 days). The physicochemical and microbial counts performed during fermentation showed the typical evolution of this type of processes, mainly dominated by yeasts in apparent absence of Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae. High-Throughput barcoded pyrosequencing analysis of ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region showed a low biodiversity of the fungal community, with the presence at 97% identity of 29 different fungal genera included in 105 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The most important genera in the raw material at the moment of reception in the industrywere Penicillium, Cladosporium, Malassezia, and Candida, whilst after 4 months of fermentation in brines Zygotorulaspora and Pichia were predominant, whereas in fruitswere Candida, Penicillium, Debaryomyces and Saccharomyces. The fungal genera Penicillium, Pichia, and Zygotorulasporawere shared among the three types of substrates during all the course of fermentation, representing the core fungal population for this table olive specialty. A phylogenetic analysis of the ITS sequences allowed a more accurate assignment of diverse OTUs to Pichia manshurica, Candida parapsilosis/C.Tropicalis, Candida diddensiae, and Citeromyces nyonensis clades. This study highlights the existence of a complex fungal consortium in olive fermentations including phytopathogenic, saprofitic, spoilage and fermentative genera. Insights into the ecology, identification and quantification of fungi species in olive fermentation will facilitate the design of new strategies to improve the quality and safety of this fermented vegetable.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","929","11","9","27636546","e0163135",NA,NA,2016

Plant diversity surely determines arthropod diversity, but only moderate correlations between arthropod and plant species richness had been observed until Basset et al. (Science, 338, 2012 and 1481) finally undertook an unprecedentedly comprehensive sampling of a tropical forest and demonstrated that plant species richness could indeed accurately predict arthropod species richness. We now require a high-throughput pipeline to operationalize this result so that we can (i) test competing explanations for tropical arthropod megadiversity, (ii) improve estimates of global eukaryotic species diversity, and (iii) use plant and arthropod communities as efficient proxies for each other, thus improving the efficiency of conservation planning and of detecting forest degradation and recovery. We therefore applied metabarcoding to Malaise-trap samples across two tropical landscapes in China. We demonstrate that plant species richness can accurately predict arthropod (mostly insect) species richness and that plant and insect community compositions are highly correlated, even in landscapes that are large, heterogeneous and anthropogenically modified. Finally, we review how metabarcoding makes feasible highly replicated tests of the major competing explanations for tropical megadiversity.","12","Journal","re","Review","100","10","Arthropoda | biodiversity | biomonitoring | host specificity | insect-plant interactions | surrogate species","20297","2012FY110800","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China","0","FALSE","930","25","17","27474399",NA,NA,NA,2016

Repeated introductions and spread of invasive mosquito species (IMS) have been recorded on a large scale these last decades worldwide. In this context, members of the mosquito genus Aedes can present serious risks to public health as they have or may develop vector competence for various viral diseases. While the Tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is a well-known vector for e.g. dengue and chikungunya viruses, the Asian bush mosquito (Ae. j. japonicus) and Ae. koreicus have shown vector competence in the field and the laboratory for a number of viruses including dengue, West Nile fever and Japanese encephalitis. Early detection and identification is therefore crucial for successful eradication or control strategies. Traditional specific identification and monitoring of different and/or cryptic life stages of the invasive Aedes species based on morphological grounds may lead to misidentifications, and are problematic when extensive surveillance is needed. In this study, we developed, tested and applied an environmental DNA (eDNA) approach for the detection of three IMS, based on water samples collected in the field in several European countries. We compared real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays specific for these three species and an eDNA metabarcoding approach with traditional sampling, and discussed the advantages and limitations of these methods. Detection probabilities for eDNA-based approaches were in most of the specific comparisons higher than for traditional survey and the results were congruent between both molecular methods, confirming the reliability and efficiency of alternative eDNA-based techniques for the early and unambiguous detection and surveillance of invasive mosquito vectors. The ease of water sampling procedures in the eDNA approach tested here allows the development of large-scale monitoringand surveillance programs of IMS, especially using citizen science projects.","17","Journal","ar","Article","100","7",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","931","11","9","27626642","e0162493",NA,NA,2016

Differences in the fungal community composition due to fire regime was likely due to associated changes that occur in vegetation with recurrent fire, via the break up of obligate symbiotic relationships.

Deeper snow keeps the arctic soils warmer and alters soil attributes and vegetation, e.g., increase in nitrogen availability, expansion of shrubs and decline in shade-intolerant lichens and bryophytes. Changes in soil properties and vegetation are expected to influence on saprotrophic and plant-symbiotic fungi, but how increased snow depth affects their community composition remain unknown. In the present work, we used DNA metabarcoding to study the effects of long-term experimental manipulations of snow depth on soil fungal communities in dry heath and moist tussock tundra in Arctic Alaska. We report strong changes in fungal community compositions in the two tundra types, with pronounced declines observed in the majority of fungal functional guilds, including ectomycorrhizal, lichenized, plant pathogenic, saprotrophic and bryophyte-associated species. The observed changes in lichenized and bryophyte-associated fungi are in agreement with previously published above-ground changes, i.e. decrease of lichen and bryophyte cover and diversity. However, the majority of observed trends, including the decline of ectomycorrhizal fungi (that were anticipated to benefit from the expansion of their host plants), suggest that changes in fungal communities do not entirely correspond to and are not primarily driven by shifts in vegetation. Instead, arctic fungal communities appear to exhibit faster turnover that may be influenced by dynamic interactions with numerous biotic and abiotic factors, e.g., soil nutrient cycling and community dynamics in other groups of soil microorganisms. We highlight the importance of “below-ground studies” in assessing ecosystem responses to climatic changes, because faster turnover of microbial communities may be applicable for monitoring early-stage alterations caused by climatic changes.","9","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Climatic changes | Fungal communities | Fungal diversity | Ion Torrent | Snow fence | Toolik lake","14802","821.01.016","National Science Foundation","1","TRUE","933","100",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S003807171630102X",2016

The past 100 years of ecological research has seen substantial progress in understanding the natural world and likely effects of change, whether natural or anthropogenic. Traditional ecological approaches underpin such advances, but would additionally benefit from recent developments in the sequence-based quantification of biodiversity from the fields of molecular ecology and genomics. By building on a long and rich history of molecular taxonomy and taking advantage of the new generation of DNA sequencing technologies, we are gaining previously impossible insights into alpha and beta diversity from all domains of life, irrespective of body size. While a number of complementary reviews are available in specialist journals, our aim here is to succinctly describe the different technologies available within the omics toolbox and showcase the opportunities available to contemporary ecologists to advance our understanding of biodiversity and its potential roles in ecosystems. Starting in the field, we walk the reader through sampling and preservation of genomic material, including typical taxonomy marker genes used for species identification. Moving on to the laboratory, we cover nucleic acid extraction approaches and highlight the principal features of using marker gene assessment, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, single-cell genomics and targeted genome sequencing as complementary approaches to assess the taxonomic and functional characteristics of biodiversity. We additionally provide clear guidance on the forms of DNA found in the environmental samples (e.g. environmental vs. ancient DNA) and highlight a selection of case studies, including the investigation of trophic relationships/food webs. Given the maturity of sequence-based identification of prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes, more exposure is given to macrobial communities. We additionally illustrate current approaches to genomic data analysis and highlight the exciting prospects of the publicly available data underpinning published sequence-based studies. Given that ecology ‘has to count’, we identify the impact that molecular genetic analyses have had on stakeholders and end-users and predict future developments for the fields of biomonitoring. Furthermore, we conclude by highlighting future opportunities in the field of systems ecology afforded by effective engagement between the fields of traditional and molecular ecology.","74","Journal","re","Review","100","8","biodiversity | DNA sequencing | metabarcoding | metagenomics | metatranscriptomics | molecular ecology","21100217611","DBI-1262480","British Ecological Society","1","TRUE","934","7","9",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

Microbial metabarcoding studies using high throughput sequencing technologies generate unprecedented amounts of DNA sequence data and make it possible to determine not only the composition of the communities but also the underlying factors powering the evolution of these communities. Despite the potential of community level studies in helping to better understand the ecology of pathogens and to manage the losses caused by them, very few oomycete addressing metabarcoding studies have been carried out and with highly variable results. The aim of this study was to develop new oomycete-specific ITS region PCR primers with improved specificity for metabarcoding and identification of oomycetes. The modified ITS1oo and the newly developed ITS3oo primers show improved in silico specificity for oomycetes and when paired with the universal ITS4 successfully amplified the DNA from all eleven tested oomycete species from six genera. High throughput sequencing of 20 soil samples from forest nurseries and bordering areas, using the primer pair ITS1oo/ITS4, recovered more than 400 oomycete OTUs, which is a significant increase over previous studies, and indicates the ability of the new method to detect various oomycete groups from complex substrates. The average fraction of oomycete reads per soil samples was 32-36%, with a maximum of 69%. The recovered oomycete OTUs represented the groups Lagenidiales, Peronosporales, Pythiales and Saprolegniales, with Pythiales dominating in all samples. In addition, the new primers were successfully used in identifying pathogens directly from infected plant tissues with Sanger sequencing. The pathogen was identified to the species or genus level in four samples out of six.

We used a cost-effective protocol and a combination of markers (tufA, 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA and 23S rDNA) to characterize the microbiome of 132 coral skeleton samples. We identified a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, many never reported in corals before. We additionally investigated the phylogenetic diversity of the green algae - the most abundant eukaryotic member of this community, for which previous literature recognizes only a handful of endolithic species. We found more than 120 taxonomic units (near species level), including six family-level lineages mostly new to science. The results suggest that the existence of lineages with an endolithic lifestyle predates the existence of modern scleractinian corals by ca. 250my, and that this particular niche was independently invaded by over 20 lineages in green algae evolution.

The authors tested the feasibility and accuracy of such an approach using dung insects of practical relevance in ecotoxicological assessments of veterinary pharmaceutical residues in the environment. They produced 8 known mixtures that varied in absolute and relative composition of small-bodied and large-bodied species to see whether mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 barcoding picks up all species qualitatively and quantitatively.

The authors recovered most species in a sample (low type I error), at minimum permitting analysis of species richness. They obtained even quantitative responses reflecting the body size of the species, although the number of specimens was not well detected. The latter is problematic when calculating diversity indices. Nevertheless, the method yielded too many closely related false positives (type II error), thus generally overestimating species diversity and richness. These errors can be reduced by refining methods and data filtering, although this requires bioinformatics expertise often unavailable where such research is carried out.

Marine environments harbour a vast diversity of micro-eukaryotic organisms (protists and other small eukaryotes) that play important roles in structuring marine ecosystems. However, micro-eukaryote diversity is not well understood. Likewise, knowledge is limited regarding micro-eukaryote spatial and seasonal distribution, especially over long temporal scales. Given the importance of this group for mobilizing energy from lower trophic levels near the base of the food chain to larger organisms, assessing community stability, diversity and resilience is important to understand ecosystem health. Herein, we use a metabarcoding approach to examine pelagic micro-eukaryote communities over a 2.5-year time series. Bimonthly surface sampling (July 2009 to December 2011) was conducted at four locations within Mobile Bay (Bay) and along the Alabama continental shelf (Shelf). Alpha-diversity only showed significant differences in Shelf sites, with the greatest differences observed between summer and winter. Beta-diversity showed significant differences in community composition in relation to season and the Bay was dominated by diatoms, while the Shelf was characterized by dinoflagellates and copepods. The northern Gulf of Mexico is heavily influenced by the Mobile River Basin, which brings low-salinity nutrient-rich water mostly during winter and spring. Community composition was correlated with salinity, temperature and dissolved silicate. However, species interactions (e.g. predation and parasitism) may also contribute to the observed variation, especially on the Shelf, which warrants further exploration. Metabarcoding revealed clear patterns in surface pelagic micro-eukaryote communities that were consistent over multiple years, demonstrating how these techniques could be greatly beneficial to ecological monitoring and management over temporal scales.","17","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","18S rRNA | diversity | Gulf of Mexico | high-throughput sequencing | Illumina","20297","T3-006-USA","Auburn University","0","FALSE","941","25","15","27238767",NA,NA,NA,2016

Many studies in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) have focused either on deep sea or continental shelf areas, while little attention has been paid to bays and coastal regions. Herein, we take a holistic approach by using high-throughput sequencing approaches to examine spatial variation in meiobenthic communities within Alabama bays and the coastal northern GOM region. Sediment samples were collected along three transects (Mississippi Sound: MS, FOCAL: FT, and Orange Beach: OB) from September 2010 to April 2012 and community composition was determined by metabarcoding the V9 hypervariable region of the nuclear18S rRNA gene.

Samples clustered in reference to transect, with the most eastern transect (OB) having a distinct community composition in comparison to the other two transects (MS and FT).

The richness of basidiomycetes decreased with prolonged submersion in the sea, supporting the general view of ascomycetes being more extremotolerant. However, more than one fourth of the fungal OTUs remained unassigned to any fungal class, emphasising the need for better DNA reference data from the marine habitat.

The use of rotations and minimum tillage in agriculture can permit more sustainable production through increasing soil organic matter and nutrients, and breaking of pathogen lifecycles. Soil fungal populations make an important physical and chemical contribution to soil. For example, mycorrhizal species are important in plant nutrition but are often overlooked when considering management practices for efficient soil function. We undertook DNA metabarcoding (Ion Torrent) using novel PCR primers and high-throughput sequencing of the D1 region of the large ribosomal subunit of the rRNA locus, to assess the effect of different forages and cereal tillage methods on the soil fungal community. The study comprised five forage treatments, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) with either low or high N, chicory (Cichorium intybus), red clover (Trifolium pratense) or white clover (Trifolium repens) grown over 3 harvest years (2010-2012). Cultivation of chicory, red clover or white clover led to significantly divergent soil fungal communities, with a notably lower diversity of fungal populations under clover, suggesting a link to soil N dynamics. Consistent with this, was a negative correlation of soil nitrate-N levels with populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and other root-associated fungal groupings (dark septate endophytes, 'CHEG', Sebacinales and Ceratobasidiaceae). In contrast, abundance of Fungi belonging to the genera Mortierella and Cryptococcus were positively correlated with soil nitrate-N, with Mortierella also being negatively correlated with soil P. Spring wheat was sown on the same plots (April 2013) followed by winter barley (October 2013). Half of each plot was sown either after ploughing or by direct drilling. A legacy effect of the preceding forage crop on the fungal community was detected after both cereal crops, with plots previously cultivated with ryegrass being most divergent. No overall effect of establishment method on fungal communities was detected but AMF and CHEG fungi were more abundant on direct-drilled plots and pathogenic fungi were more abundant on ploughed plots after the sowing of winter barley.","25","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Arable crops | Mycorrhiza | NextGen sequencing | Soil disturbance | Soil fungi | Sustainable agriculture","15110","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","946","228",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0167880916302250",2016

Organisms continuously release DNA into their environments via shed cells, excreta, gametes and decaying material. Analysis of this ‘environmental DNA’ (eDNA) is revolutionizing biodiversity monitoring. eDNA outperforms many established survey methods for targeted detection of single species, but few studies have investigated how well eDNA reflects whole communities of organisms in natural environments. We investigated whether eDNA can recover accurate qualitative and quantitative information about fish communities in large lakes, by comparison to the most comprehensive long-term gill-net data set available in the UK. Seventy-eight 2L water samples were collected along depth profile transects, gill-net sites and from the shoreline in three large, deep lakes (Windermere, Bassenthwaite Lake and Derwent Water) in the English Lake District. Water samples were assayed by eDNA metabarcoding of the mitochondrial 12S and cytochrome b regions. Fourteen of the 16 species historically recorded in Windermere were detected using eDNA, compared to four species in the most recent gill-net survey, demonstrating eDNA is extremely sensitive for detecting species. A key question for biodiversity monitoring is whether eDNA can accurately estimate abundance. To test this, we used the number of sequence reads per species and the proportion of sampling sites in which a species was detected with eDNA (i.e. site occupancy) as proxies for abundance. eDNA abundance data consistently correlated with rank abundance estimates from established surveys. These results demonstrate that eDNA metabarcoding can describe fish communities in large lakes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and has great potential as a complementary tool to established monitoring methods.","64","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","EC water framework directive | EDNA | Environmental DNA | Fish monitoring | Lakes | Lentic systems | Metabarcoding","20297","SC140018",NA,"0","FALSE","951","25","13","27095076",NA,NA,NA,2016

We characterised soil bacterial and fungal communities in response to the soil treatment with microencapsulated terpene, Brassica seedmeal (BioFence™) and chloropicrin in a field trial. The effect of soil treatments on the overall microbial population structure and relative abundance of individual microbial OTUs (operational taxonomic units) was assessed using an amplicon-based metabarcoding approach at three time points. Classifying representative OTU sequences into taxonomic groups was more uncertain for bacteria than for fungi. Chloropicrin dramatically altered both bacterial and fungal populations within four weeks of application. The effect on bacterial population structure is short-lived and became non-significant 16 weeks after treatment; however, fungal population structure was more persistently affected by chloropicrin.

Human population expansion and associated degradation of the habitat of many wildlife species cause loss of biodiversity and species extinctions. The small Simen Mountains National Park in Ethiopia is one of the last strongholds for the preservation of a number of afro-alpine mammals, plants and birds, and it is home to the rare endemic Walia ibex, Capra walie. The narrow distribution range of this species as well as potential competition for resources with livestock, especially with domestic goat, Capra hircus, may compromise its future survival. Based on a curated afro-alpine taxonomic reference library constructed for plant taxon identification, we investigated the diet of the Walia ibex and addressed the dietary overlap with domestic goat using DNA metabarcoding of faecal samples. Faeces of both species were collected from different localities in the National Park. We show that both species are browsers, with forbs, shrubs and trees comprising the largest proportion of their diet, supplemented by grasses. There was a considerable overlap in dietary preferences. Several of the preferred diet items of the Walia ibex (Alchemilla sp., Hypericum revolutum, Erica arborea and Rumex sp.) were also among the most preferred diet items of the domestic goat. These results indicate that there is potential for competition between the two species, especially during the dry season, when resources are limited. Our findings, in combination with the expected increase in domestic herbivores, suggest that management plans should consider the potential threat posed by domestic goats to ensure future survival of the endangered Walia ibex.","8","Journal","ar","Article","100","13",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","955","11","7","27416020","e0159133",NA,NA,2016

Metabarcoding is becoming an increasingly valuable alternative approach to biodiversity assessment, due to the combination of extreme sensitivity and potential for the highest taxonomic resolution in a cost- and time-effective methodology. To evaluate the capacity of metabarcoding for estuarine plankton monitoring, a comparison between the results obtained with this approach were compared with those based on traditional taxonomic analysis (microscopy). Database incompleteness, one of the main limitations of metabarcoding, was somewhat overcome by the addition of DNA sequences for local species, which increased the taxonomic assignment success from 23.7 to 50.5 %. When the communities were studied along with environmental variables, similar spatial and temporal trends of taxonomic diversity were observed for metabarcoding and microscopic studies of zooplankton, but not for phytoplankton. This is most likely attributable to the lack of representative sequences for phytoplankton species in current databases. In addition, there was high correspondence in community composition when comparing abundances estimated from metabarcoding and microscopy, suggesting semiquantitative potential for metabarcoding. Furthermore, metabarcoding allowed the detection and identification of two non-indigenous species (NIS) found in the study area at abundances hardly detectable by microscopy. Overall, our results indicate that metabarcoding is a powerful approach with excellent possibilities for use in plankton monitoring, early detection of NIS and plankton biodiversity shifts.","17","Journal","ar","Article","100","8",NA,"12165","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","956","163","7",NA,"149",NA,NA,2016

Species identification using DNA barcodes has been widely adopted by forensic scientists as an effective molecular tool for tracking adulterations in food and for analysing samples from alleged wildlife crime incidents. DNA barcoding is an approach that involves sequencing of short DNA sequences from standardized regions and comparison to a reference database as a molecular diagnostic tool in species identification. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made towards developing DNA metabarcoding strategies, which involves next-generation sequencing of DNA barcodes for the simultaneous detection of multiple species in complex samples. Metabarcoding strategies can be used in processed materials containing highly degraded DNA e.g. for the identification of endangered and hazardous species in traditional medicine. This review aims to provide insight into advances of plant and animal DNA barcoding and highlights current practices and recent developments for DNA metabarcoding of food and wildlife forensic samples from a practical point of view. Special emphasis is placed on new developments for identifying species listed in the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) appendices for which reliable methods for species identification may signal and/or prevent illegal trade.

Coral reefs harbor the most diverse assemblages in the ocean, however, a large proportion of the diversity is cryptic and, therefore, undetected by standard visual census techniques. Cryptic and exposed communities differ considerably in species composition and ecological function. This study compares three different coral reef assessment protocols: i) visual benthic reef surveys: ii) visual census of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) plates; and iii) metabarcoding techniques of the ARMS (including sessile, 106-500 µm and 500-2000 µm size fractions), that target the cryptic and exposed communities of three reefs in the central Red Sea. Visual census showed a dominance of Cnidaria (Anthozoa) and Rhodophyta on the reef substrate, while Porifera, Bryozoa and Rhodophyta were the most abundant groups on the ARMS plates. Metabarcoding, targeting the 18S rRNA gene, significantly increased estimates of the species diversity (p < 0.001); revealing that Annelida were generally the dominant phyla (in terms of reads) of all fractions and reefs. Furthermore, metabarcoding detected microbial eukaryotic groups such as Syndiniophyceae, Mamiellophyceae and Bacillariophyceae as relevant components of the sessile fraction. ANOSIM analysis showed that the three reef sites showed no differences based on the visual census data. Metabarcoding showed a higher sensitivity for identifying differences between reef communities at smaller geographic scales than standard visual census techniques as significant differences in the assemblages were observed amongst the reefs. Comparison of the techniques showed no similar patterns for the visual techniques while the metabarcoding of the ARMS showed similar patterns amongst fractions. Establishing ARMS as a standard tool in reef monitoring will not only advance our understanding of local processes and ecological community response to environmental changes, as different faunal components will provide complementary information but also improve the estimates of biodiversity in coral reef benthic communities. This study lays the foundations for further studies looking at integrating traditional reef survey methodologies with complementary approaches, such as metabarcoding, which investigate other components of the reef community.","12","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Autonomous reef monitoring structures | Benthos | Biodiversity surveys | Coral reefs | Marine ecology | Metabarcoding | Monitoring | Red Sea","24021","308392","King Abdullah University of Science and Technology","1","TRUE","958","118",NA,"27149573",NA,"KAUST","S0141113616300617",2016

A macroecological perspective is also important at local scales: a full understanding of local biodiversity drivers, including human impact, demands that regional processes be taken into account. This requires knowledge of which species could inhabit a site (the species pool), including those that are currently absent (dark diversity). Macroecology of biodiversity is currently advancing quickly owing to an unprecedented accumulation of biodiversity data, new sampling techniques and analytical methods, all of which better equip us to face current and future challenges in ecology and biodiversity conservation.","15","Journal","re","Review","100","3","arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi | biogeography | community assembly | ectomycorrhizal fungi | latitudinal gradient | metabarcoding | soil pH | species richness","19908","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","959","211","2","27040897",NA,NA,NA,2016

The human impact on natural habitats is increasing the complexity of human-wildlife interactions and leading to the emergence of infectious diseases worldwide. Highly successful synanthropic wildlife species, such as rodents, will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in transmitting zoonotic diseases. We investigated the potential for recent developments in 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to facilitate the multiplexing of the large numbers of samples needed to improve our understanding of the risk of zoonotic disease transmission posed by urban rodents in West Africa. In addition to listing pathogenic bacteria in wild populations, as in other high-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies, our approach can estimate essential parameters for studies of zoonotic risk, such as prevalence and patterns of coinfection within individual hosts. However, the estimation of these parameters requires cleaning of the raw data to mitigate the biases generated by HTS methods. We present here an extensive review of these biases and of their consequences, and we propose a comprehensive trimming strategy for managing these biases. We demonstrated the application of this strategy using 711 commensal rodents, including 208 Mus musculus domesticus, 189 Rattus rattus, 93 Mastomys natalensis, and 221 Mastomys erythroleucus, collected from 24 villages in Senegal. Seven major genera of pathogenic bacteria were detected in their spleens: Borrelia, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, Streptobacillus, and Orientia. Mycoplasma, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, Streptobacillus, and Orientia have never before been detected in West African rodents. Bacterial prevalence ranged from 0% to 90% of individuals per site, depending on the bacterial taxon, rodent species, and site considered, and 26% of rodents displayed coinfection. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing strategy presented here has the advantage over other molecular surveillance tools of dealing with a large spectrum of bacterial pathogens without requiring assumptions about their presence in the samples. This approach is therefore particularly suitable to continuous pathogen surveillance in the context of disease-monitoring programs.","24","Journal","ar","Article","100","13","Bacteria | Emerging infectious diseases | High-throughput sequencing | Metabarcoding | Molecular epidemiology | Next-generation sequencing | Rodents | West Africa | Zoonoses","21100850723","ENEMI ANR-11-JSV7-0006","Agence Nationale de la Recherche","1","TRUE","960","1","4",NA,"e00032",NA,NA,2016

Metabarcoding has become an important tool in the discovery of biodiversity, including fungi, which are the second most speciose group of eukaryotes, with diverse and important ecological roles in terrestrial ecosystems. We have designed and tested new PCR primers that target the D1 variable region of nuclear large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA; one set that targets the phylum Ascomycota and another that recovers all other fungal phyla. The primers yield amplicons compatible with the Illumina MiSeq platform, which is cost-effective and has a lower error rate than other high throughput sequencing platforms. The new primer set LSU200A-F/LSU476A-R (Ascomycota) yielded 95-98% of reads of target taxa from environmental samples, and primers LSU200-F/LSU481-R (all other fungi) yielded 72-80% of target reads. Both primer sets have fairly low rates of data loss, and together they cover a wide variety of fungal taxa. We compared our results with these primers by amplifying and sequencing a subset of samples using the previously described ITS3-KYO2/ITS4-KYO3 primers, which amplify the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. With approximately equivalent read depth, our LSU primers recovered a greater number and phylogenetic diversity of sequences than the ITS2 primers. For instance, ITS3-KYO2/ITS4-KYO3 primers failed to pick up any members of Eurotiales, Mytilinidiales, Pezizales, Saccharomycetales, or Venturiales within Ascomycota, or members of Exobasidiomycetes, Microbotryomycetes, Pucciniomycetes, or Tremellomycetes within Basidiomycota, which were retrieved in good numbers from the same samples by our LSU primers. Among the OTUs recovered using the LSU primers were 127 genera and 28 species that were not obtained using the ITS2 primers, although the ITS2 primers recovered 10 unique genera and 16 species that were not obtained using either of the LSU primers These features identify the new primer sets developed in this study as useful complements to other universal primers for the study of fungal diversity and community composition.","12","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","962","11","7","27391306","e0159043",NA,NA,2016

Although soil microorganisms play a pivotal role in delivering various ecosystem functions and services, we are only beginning to understand how microbial communities are shaped by various soil physical properties and environmental factors. In this study, we integrate metabarcoding of bacteria and fungi and soil physical measurements at 60 locations on a 15 × 15 m grid in an agricultural field to: (1) characterize the spatial variation of microbial richness and diversity, and (2) identify the soil physical parameters that are most strongly correlated with them. The study field is located in Silstrup Denmark, extends over 1.69 ha, and slopes 1-2° to the north. Soil samples for 454-pyrosequencing were extracted by pushing 50-mL sterilized plastic vials into the soil. Bulk soil samples were used for the measurement of pH, organic carbon, and soil texture. Intact 100 cm 3 soil cores, collected in triplicate, were used for measuring the soil water characteristic curve. Across the field, bacterial richness (number of OTUs) and diversity indices (Shannon diversity and phylogenetic diversity) showed strong spatial autocorrelations. Fungal number of OTUs was quite similar over the field and thus no spatial autocorrelation was observed for them. Fungal Shannon diversity slightly increased from south to north, with spatial autocorrelation for distances larger than 100 m. The ratio of clay to organic carbon (n) was found to be the best predictor of bacterial richness and diversity indices. Neither organic carbon nor clay content was significantly correlated with fungal richness and diversity indices. For soil structural parameters, soil water retention in the pF range 5-6.8 (parameter B) was significantly correlated with both bacterial and fungal Shannon diversities. Amount of macropores (> 30 µm) and total porosity (f) were only significantly correlated with fungal Shannon diversity. These results suggest that variation in microbial communities is not random but strongly related with variations in organic carbon, clay content, and soil water characteristics at the field scale.","18","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Bacterial diversity | Fungal diversity | Ratio of clay to organic carbon | Soil texture | Soil water characteristics","96119","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","963","103",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S092913931630066X",2016

Dietary choices are central to our understanding of ecology and evolution. Still, many aspects of food choice have been hampered by time consuming procedures and methodological problems. Faster and cheaper methods, such as DNA metabarcoding, have therefore been widely adopted. However, there is still very little empirical support that this new method is better and more accurate compared to the classic methods. Here, we compare DNA metabarcoding to macroscopic identifications of rumen contents in two species of wild free-ranging ungulates: roe deer and fallow deer. We found that the methods were comparable, but they did not completely overlap. Sometimes the DNA method failed to identify food items that were found macroscopically, and the opposite was also true. However, the total number of taxa identified increased using DNA compared to the macroscopic analysis. Moreover, the taxonomic precision of metabarcoding was substantially higher, with on average 90% of DNA-sequences being identified to genus or species level compared to 75% of plant fragments using macroscopy. In niche overlap analyses, presence/absence data showed that both methods came to very similar conclusions. When using the sequence count data and macroscopic weight, niche overlap was lower than when using presenceabsence data yet tended to increase when using DNA compared to macroscopy. Nevertheless, the significant positive correlation between macroscopic quantity and number of DNA sequences counted from the same plant group give support for the use of metabarcoding to quantify plants in the rumen. This study thus shows that there is much to be gained by using metabarcoding to quantitatively assess diet composition compared to macroscopic analysis, including higher taxonomic precision, sensitivity and cost efficiency.","8","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"10600153309","undefined","California Environmental Protection Agency","1","TRUE","964","11","6","27322387","e0157977","CalEPA",NA,2016

Metabarcoding experiments on pollen DNA mixtures described a positive relationship between the amounts of DNA from focal species and the number of trnL and ITS1 sequences yielded. The study of pollen loads of insects captured in plant communities revealed that as compared to the observation of visits, metabarcoding revealed 2.5 times more plant species involved in plant-pollinator interactions.

The number of visits received per plant species also positively correlated to the number of their ITS1 and trnL sequences in insect pollen loads.

In the last few years, the study of environmental DNA (eDNA) has drawn attention for many reasons, including its advantages for monitoring and conservation purposes. So far, in aquatic environments, most of eDNA research has focused on the detection of single species using species-specific markers. Recently, species inventories based on the analysis of a single generalist marker targeting a larger taxonomic group (eDNA metabarcoding) have proven useful for bony fish and amphibian biodiversity surveys. This approach involves in situ filtering of large volumes of water followed by amplification and sequencing of a short discriminative fragment from the 12S rDNA mitochondrial gene. In this study, we went one step further by investigating the spatial representativeness (i.e. ecological reliability and signal variability in space) of eDNA metabarcoding for large-scale fish biodiversity assessment in a freshwater system including lentic and lotic environments. We tested the ability of this approach to characterize large-scale organization of fish communities along a longitudinal gradient, from a lake to the outflowing river. First, our results confirm that eDNA metabarcoding is more efficient than a single traditional sampling campaign to detect species presence, especially in rivers. Second, the species list obtained using this approach is comparable to the one obtained when cumulating all traditional sampling sessions since 1995 and 1988 for the lake and the river, respectively. In conclusion, eDNA metabarcoding gives a faithful description of local fish biodiversity in the study system, more specifically within a range of a few kilometers along the river in our study conditions, i.e. longer than a traditional fish sampling site.","28","Journal","ar","Article","100","8",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","966","11","6","27359116","e0157366",NA,NA,2016

In a rapidly changing world we need methods to efficiently assess biodiversity in order to monitor ecosystem trends. Ecological monitoring often uses plant community composition to infer quality of sites but conventional aboveground surveys only capture a snapshot of the actively growing plant diversity. Environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from soil samples, however, can include taxa represented by both active and dormant tissues, seeds, pollen, and detritus. Analysis of this eDNA through DNA metabarcoding provides a more comprehensive view of plant diversity at a site from a single assessment but it is not clear which DNA markers are best used to capture this diversity. Sequence recovery, annotation, and sequence resolution among taxa were evaluated for four established DNA markers (matK, rbcL, ITS2, and the trnL P6 loop) in silico using database sequences and in situ using high throughput sequencing of 35 soil samples from a remote boreal wetland. Overall, ITS2 and rbcL are recommended for DNA metabarcoding of vascular plants from eDNA when not using customized or geographically restricted reference databases. We describe a new framework for evaluating DNA metabarcodes and, contrary to existing assumptions, we found that full length DNA barcode regions could outperform shorter markers for surveying plant diversity from soil samples. By using current DNA barcoding markers rbcL and ITS2 for plant metabarcoding, we can take advantage of existing resources such as the growing DNA barcode database. Our work establishes the value of standard DNA barcodes for soil plant eDNA analysis in ecological investigations and biomonitoring programs and supports the collaborative development of DNA barcoding and metabarcoding.Copyright:","28","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"10600153309","undefined","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","1","TRUE","967","11","6","27310720","e0157505",NA,NA,2016

The foundation for any ecological study and for the effective management of biodiversity in natural systems requires knowing what species are present in an ecosystem. We assessed fish communities in a stream using two methods, depletion-based electrofishing and environmental DNA metabarcoding (eDNA) from water samples, to test the hypothesis that eDNA provides an alternative means of determining species richness and species identities for a natural ecosystem. In a northern Indiana stream, electrofishing yielded a direct estimate of 12 species and a mean estimated richness (Chao II estimator) of 16.6 species with a 95% confidence interval from 12.8 to 42.2. eDNA sampling detected an additional four species, congruent with the mean Chao II estimate from electrofishing. This increased detection rate for fish species between methods suggests that eDNA sampling can enhance estimation of fish fauna in flowing waters while having minimal sampling impacts on fish and their habitat. Modern genetic approaches therefore have the potential to transform our ability to build a more complete list of species for ecological investigations and inform management of aquatic ecosystems.","28","Journal","ar","Article","100","13","Chao estimator | electrofishing | freshwater community | metabarcoding | species identity","21100264002","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","968","6","12",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

Seeds have evolved in association with diverse microbial assemblages that may influence plant growth and health. However, little is known about the composition of seed-associated microbial assemblages and the ecological processes shaping their structures. In this work, we monitored the relative influence of the host genotypes and terroir on the structure of the seed microbiota through metabarcoding analysis of different microbial assemblages associated to five different bean cultivars harvested in two distinct farms. Overall, few bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were conserved across all seed samples. The lack of shared OTUs between samples is explained by a significant effect of the farm site on the structure of microbial assemblage, which explained 12.2% and 39.7% of variance in bacterial and fungal diversity across samples. This site-specific effect is reflected by the significant enrichment of 70 OTUs in Brittany and 88 OTUs in Luxembourg that lead to differences in co-occurrence patterns. In contrast, variance in microbial assemblage structure was not explained by host genotype. Altogether, these results suggest that seed-associated microbial assemblage is determined by niche-based processes and that the terroir is a key driver of these selective forces.","24","Journal","ar","Article","100","8",NA,"19683","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","969","18","6","26171841",NA,NA,NA,2016

Symbiotic partnerships between heterotrophic hosts and intracellular microalgae are common in tropical and subtropical oligotrophic waters of benthic and pelagic marine habitats. The iconic example is the photosynthetic dinoflagellate genus Symbiodinium that establishes mutualistic symbioses with a wide diversity of benthic hosts, sustaining highly biodiverse reef ecosystems worldwide. Paradoxically, although various species of photosynthetic dinoflagellates are prevalent eukaryotic symbionts in pelagic waters, Symbiodinium has not yet been reported in symbiosis within oceanic plankton, despite its high propensity for the symbiotic lifestyle. Here we report a new pelagic photosymbiosis between a calcifying ciliate host and the microalga Symbiodinium in surface ocean waters. Confocal and scanning electron microscopy, together with an 18S rDNA-based phylogeny, showed that the host is a new ciliate species closely related to Tiarina fusus (Colepidae). Phylogenetic analyses of the endosymbionts based on the 28S rDNA gene revealed multiple novel closely related Symbiodinium clade A genotypes. A haplotype network using the high-resolution internal transcribed spacer-2 marker showed that these genotypes form eight divergent, biogeographically structured, subclade types that do not seem to associate with any benthic hosts. Ecological analyses using the Tara Oceans metabarcoding data set (V9 region of the 18S rDNA) and contextual oceanographic parameters showed a global distribution of the symbiotic partnership in nutrient-poor surface waters. The discovery of the symbiotic life of Symbiodinium in the open ocean provides new insights into the ecology and evolution of this pivotal microalga and raises new hypotheses about coastal pelagic connectivity.","11","Journal","ar","Article","100","11",NA,"5800173382","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","970","10","6","26684730",NA,NA,NA,2016

Metabarcoding (large-scale taxonomic identification of complex samples via analysis of one or few orthologous DNA regions, called barcodes) is revolutionizing analysis of biodiversity of marine zooplankton assemblages. Metabarcoding relies on high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) technologies, which yield millions of DNA sequences in parallel and allow large-scale analysis of environmental samples. Metabarcoding studies of marine zooplankton have used various regions of nuclear small-(18S) and large-subunit (28S) rRNA, which allow accurate classification of novel sequences and reliable amplification with consensus primers, but-due to their relatively conserved nature-may underestimate species diversity in a community. To discriminate species, more variable genes are needed. A limited number of metabarcoding studies have used mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI), which ensures detection of species-level diversity, but may require group-specific primers and thus result in inconsistent amplification success rates. Reference databases with sequences for accurately-identified species are critically needed to allow taxonomic designation of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTU) and comparison with previous studies of zooplankton diversity. Potential and promising applications of metabarcoding include rapid detection of impacts of climate change, monitoring and assessment of ecosystem health, calculation of biotic indices, characterization of food webs and detection of introduced, non-indigenous species.","34","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Biodiversity | DNA barcoding | High-throughput DNA sequencing | Metabarcoding | Zooplankton","29635","IT558-10","Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences","1","TRUE","971","38","3",NA,NA,"UCONN",NA,2016

The compositions of fungal communities across these three sea regions were found to be vary, which may be attributed to sediment source, geographical distance, latitude and some environmental factors such as the temperature and salinity of bottom water, water depth, total nitrogen, and the ratio of total organic carbon to nitrogen. Among these environmental factors, the temperature of bottom water is the most important driver that governs the distribution patterns of fungal communities across the sampled seas.

One recent laboratory development is the addition of 5'-nucleotide tags to both primers producing double-tagged amplicons and the use of multiple PCR replicates to filter erroneous sequences. However, there is currently no available toolkit for the straightforward analysis of datasets produced in this way. Results: We present DAMe, a toolkit for the processing of datasets generated by double-tagged amplicons from multiple PCR replicates derived from an unlimited number of samples. Specifically, DAMe can be used to (i) sort amplicons by tag combination, (ii) evaluate PCR replicates dissimilarity, and (iii) filter sequences derived from sequencing/PCR errors, chimeras, and contamination. This is attained by calculating the following parameters: (i) sequence content similarity between the PCR replicates from each sample, (ii) reproducibility of each unique sequence across the PCR replicates, and (iii) copy number of the unique sequences in each PCR replicate. We showcase the insights that can be obtained using DAMe prior to taxonomic assignment, by applying it to two real datasets that vary in their complexity regarding number of samples, sequencing libraries, PCR replicates, and used tag combinations. Finally, we use a third mock dataset to demonstrate the impact and importance of filtering the sequences with DAMe. Conclusions: DAMe allows the user-friendly manipulation of amplicons derived from multiple samples with PCR replicates built in a single or multiple sequencing libraries. It allows the user to: (i) collapse amplicons into unique sequences and sort them by tag combination while retaining the sample identifier and copy number information, (ii) identify sequences carrying unused tag combinations, (iii) evaluate the comparability of PCR replicates of the same sample, and (iv) filter tagged amplicons from a number of PCR replicates using parameters of minimum length, copy number, and reproducibility across the PCR replicates. This enables an efficient analysis of complex datasets, and ultimately increases the ease of handling datasets from large-scale studies.","8","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Demultiplexing | DNA metabarcoding | Double-tagged amplicons | Environmental DNA | High throughput sequencing | Tag jumping","19600166028","R52-A5062","Lundbeckfonden","1","TRUE","973","9","1","27142414","255",NA,NA,2016

Regular biological surveys are essential for informed management of freshwater ecosystems. However, current morphology-based biodiversity surveys can be invasive, time-consuming, and financially expensive. Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA) sequencing has been suggested as an alternative non-invasive, time- and cost-effective biological survey tool. However, eDNA sequencing tools require experimental validation in natural ecosystems before confidence in their use can be assumed. In this study, we compare fish community data obtained via eDNA metabarcoding to that of conventional fyke netting within two complex and drought-prone river systems. We also compare different eDNA sampling strategies and genetic markers for detecting rare and threatened fish species. We were able to detect 100% of the fyke net caught-species from eDNA when appropriate sampling strategies were used, including threatened and invasive species. Specifically, we found that two 1 L water samples per site were insufficient for detecting less abundant taxa; however, five 1 L samples per site enabled a 100% detection rate. Further, sampling eDNA from the water column appeared to be more effective for detecting fish communities than eDNA from sediments. However, on a per site basis, community discrepancies existed between the two methods, highlighting the benefits and limitations of both approaches. We demonstrate that careful interpretation of eDNA data is crucial as bioinformatic identification of sequences, without logical inference or local knowledge, can lead to erroneous conclusions. We discuss these discrepancies and provide recommendations for fish eDNA metabarcoding surveys.","45","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Aquatic | Biomonitoring | EDNA | Freshwater | NGS | River Murray","17244","LP0991985","Australian Research Council","0","FALSE","975","197",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S000632071630088X",2016

Aim: The urgent need for large-scale spatio-temporal assessments of biodiversity in the face of rapid environmental change prompts technological advancements in species identification and biomonitoring such as metabarcoding. The high-throughput DNA sequencing of bulk samples offers many advantages over traditional morphological identification for describing community composition. Our objective was to evaluate the applicability of metabarcoding to identify species in taxonomically complex samples, evaluate biodiversity trends across broad geographical and temporal scales and facilitate cross-study comparisons. Location: Marine and freshwater ports along Canadian coastlines (Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic) and the Great Lakes. Methods: We used metabarcoding of bulk zooplankton samples to identify species and profile biodiversity across habitats and seasons in busy commercial ports. A taxonomic assignment approach circumventing sequence clustering was implemented to provide increased resolution and accuracy compared to pre-clustering. Results: Taxonomic classification of over seven million sequences identified organisms spanning around 400 metazoan families and complements previous surveys based on morphological identification. Metabarcoding revealed over 30 orders that were previously not reported, while certain taxonomic groups were underrepresented because of depauperate reference databases. Despite the limitations of assigning metabarcoding data to the species level, zooplankton communities were distinct among coastlines and significantly divergent among marine, freshwater and estuarine habitats even at the family level. Furthermore, biodiversity varied substantially across two seasons reaching a beta diversity of 0.9 in a sub-Arctic port exposed to high vessel traffic. Main Conclusions: Metabarcoding offers a powerful and sensitive approach to conduct large-scale biodiversity surveys and allows comparability across studies when rooted in taxonomy. We highlight ways of overcoming current limitations of metabarcoding for identifying species and assessing biodiversity, which has important implications for detecting organisms at low abundance such as endangered species and early invaders. Our study conveys pertinent and timely considerations for future large-scale monitoring surveys in relationship to environmental change.","30","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","18S | Biodiversity | Bioinformatics | Biomonitoring | DNA barcoding | OTU clustering","14551","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","976","22","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

DNA metabarcoding is a powerful new tool allowing characterization of species assemblages using high-throughput amplicon sequencing. The utility of DNA metabarcoding for quantifying relative species abundances is currently limited by both biological and technical biases which influence sequence read counts. We tested the idea of sequencing 50/50 mixtures of target species and a control species in order to generate relative correction factors (RCFs) that account for multiple sources of bias and are applicable to field studies. RCFs will be most effective if they are not affected by input mass ratio or co-occurring species. In a model experiment involving three target fish species and a fixed control, we found RCFs did vary with input ratio but in a consistent fashion, and that 50/50 RCFs applied to DNA sequence counts from various mixtures of the target species still greatly improved relative abundance estimates (e.g. average per species error of 19 ± 8% for uncorrected vs. 3 ± 1% for corrected estimates). To demonstrate the use of correction factors in a field setting, we calculated 50/50 RCFs for 18 harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) prey species (RCFs ranging from 0.68 to 3.68). Applying these corrections to field-collected seal scats affected species percentages from individual samples (<U+0394> 6.7 ± 6.6%) more than population-level species estimates (<U+0394> 1.7 ± 1.2%). Our results indicate that the 50/50 RCF approach is an effective tool for evaluating and correcting biases in DNA metabarcoding studies. The decision to apply correction factors will be influenced by the feasibility of creating tissue mixtures for the target species, and the level of accuracy needed to meet research objectives.","58","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Diet analysis | DNA barcoding | Environmental DNA | Predator prey interactions","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","977","16","3","26602877",NA,NA,NA,2016

The Author(s). The concept of using specific regions of DNA to identify organisms - processes such as DNA barcoding - is not new to South African biologists. The African Centre for DNA Barcoding reports that 12 548 plant species and 1493 animal species had been barcoded in South Africa by July 2013, while the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) contains 62 926 records for South Africa, 11 392 of which had species names (representing 4541 species). In light of this, it is surprising that aquatic macroinvertebrates of South Africa have not received much attention as potential barcoding projects thus far - barcoding of aquatic species has tended to focus on invasive species and fishes. Perusal of the BOLD records for South Africa indicates a noticeable absence of aquatic macroinvertebrates, including families used for biomonitoring strategies such as the South African Scoring System. Meanwhile, the approach of collecting specimens and isolating their DNA individually in order to identify them (as in the case of DNA barcoding), has been shifting towards making use of the DNA which organisms naturally shed into their environments (eDNA). Coupling environmental and bulk sample DNA with high-throughput sequencing technology has given rise to metabarcoding, which has the potential to characterise the whole community of organisms present in an environment. Harnessing barcoding and metabarcoding approaches with environmental DNA (eDNA) potentially offers a non-invasive means of measuring the biodiversity in an environment and has great potential for biomonitoring.

Our results demonstrate that soil fungal communities in Puerto Rico are structured by ecosystem. Ascomycota, followed by Basidiomycota, dominates the diversity of fungi in soil. Amongst Ascomycota, the recently described soil-inhabiting class Archaeorhizomycetes was present in all localities, and taxa in Archaeorhizomycetes were among the most commonly observed MOTUs.

Background: Rapid habitat loss and degradation are responsible for population decline in a growing number of species. Understanding the natural history of these species is important for designing conservation strategies, such as habitat enhancements or ex-situ conservation. The acquisition of observational data may be difficult for rare and declining species, but metagenomics and metabarcoding can provide novel kinds of information. Here we use these methods for analysing fecal samples from an endangered population of a colobine primate, the banded leaf monkey (Presbytis femoralis). Results: We conducted metagenomics via shotgun sequencing on six fecal samples obtained from a remnant population of P. femoralis in a species-rich rainforest patch in Singapore. Shotgun sequencing and identification against a plant barcode reference database reveals a broad dietary profile consisting of at least 53 plant species from 33 families. The diet includes exotic plant species and is broadly consistent with > 2 years of observational data. Metagenomics identified 15 of the 24 plant genera for which there is observational data, but also revealed at least 36 additional species. DNA traces for the diet species were recovered and identifiable in the feces despite long digestion times and a large number of potential food plants within the rainforest habitat (>700 species). We also demonstrate that metagenomics provides greater taxonomic resolution of food plant species by utilizing multiple genetic markers as compared to single-marker metabarcoding. In addition, full mitochondrial genomes of P. femoralis individuals were reconstructed from fecal metagenomic shotgun reads, showing very low levels of genetic diversity in the focal population, and the presence of gut parasites could also be confirmed. Metagenomics thus allows for the simultaneous assessment of diet, population genetics and gut parasites based on fecal samples. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that metagenomic shotgun sequencing of fecal samples can be successfully used to rapidly obtain natural history data for understudied species with a complex diet. We predict that metagenomics will become a routinely used tool in conservation biology once the cost per sample reduces to ~100 USD within the next few years.","29","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Banded leaf monkeys | Colobines | Diet analyses | Metabarcoding | Metagenomics","130152","R-347-000-198-490","American Museum of Natural History","1","TRUE","983","13","1",NA,"17",NA,NA,2016

The biodiversity of tropical forests consists primarily of small organisms that are difficult to detect and characterize. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods can facilitate analyses of these arthropod and microbial communities, leading to a better understanding of existing diversity and factors influencing community assembly. The pitchers of carnivorous pitcher plants often house surprisingly discrete communities and provide ideal systems for analysis using an NGS approach. The plants digest insects in order to access essential nutrients while growing in poor soils; however, the pitchers are also home to communities of living organisms, called inquilines. Certain arthropods appear to have coevolved with their pitcher plant hosts and are not found in other environments. We used Illumina amplicon sequencing of 18S rDNA to characterize the eukaryotes in three species of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) pitcher plants - N.gracilis, N.rafflesiana and N.ampullaria - in each of three different parks in Singapore. The data reveal an unexpected diversity of eukaryotes, significant differences in community diversity among host species, variation in host specificity of inquilines and the presence of gregarine parasites. Counts of whole inquiline arthropods from the first collection year were roughly correlated with scaled 18S sequence abundances, indicating that amplicon sequencing is an effective means of gauging community structure. We barcoded a subset of the dipteran larvae using COI primers, and the resulting phylogenetic tree is mostly congruent with that found using the 18S locus, with the exception of one of five morphospecies. For many 18S and COI sequences, the best BLASTn matches showed low sequence identity, illustrating the need for better databases of Southeast Asian dipterans.

According to optimal foraging theory, prehibernating bats should adopt a less selective feeding behaviour - yet empirical studies have revealed many apparently generalized species to be composed of specialist individuals. Targeting the diet of the bat Myotis daubentonii, we used a combination of molecular techniques to test for seasonal changes in prey selectivity and individual-level variation in prey preferences. DNA metabarcoding was used to characterize both the prey contents of bat droppings and the insect community available as prey. To test for dietary differences among M. daubentonii individuals, we used ten microsatellite loci to assign droppings to individual bats. The comparison between consumed and available prey revealed a preference for certain prey items regardless of availability. Nonbiting midges (Chironomidae) remained the most highly consumed prey at all times, despite a significant increase in the availability of black flies (Simuliidae) towards the end of the season. The bats sampled showed no evidence of individual specialization in dietary preferences. Overall, our approach offers little support for optimal foraging theory. Thus, it shows how novel combinations of genetic markers can be used to test general theory, targeting patterns at both the level of prey communities and individual predators.","28","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","diet analysis | DNA barcoding | insects | Myotis daubentonii | population ecology | predator-prey interactions","20297","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","987","25","7","26841188",NA,NA,NA,2016

We developed a novel protocol with superior quantitative analysis results for DNA metabarcoding of Collembola, a major soil microarthropod order. Degenerate PCR primers were designed for conserved regions in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) and 16S ribosomal RNA (mt16S) genes based on published collembolan mitogenomes. The best primer pair was selected based on its ability to amplify each gene, irrespective of the species. DNA was extracted from 10 natural communities sampled in a temperate forest (with typically 25-30 collembolan species per 10 soil samples) and 10 mock communities (with seven cultured collembolan species). The two gene regions were then amplified using the selected primers, ligated with adapters for 454 technology, and sequenced. Examination of the natural community samples showed that 32 and 36 operational taxonomic units (defined at a 90% sequence similarity threshold) were recovered from the mtCOI and mt16S data, respectively, which were comparable to the results of the microscopic identification of 25 morphospecies. Further, sequence abundances for each collembolan species from the mtCOI and mt16S data of the mock communities, after normalization by using a species as the internal control, showed good correlation with the number of individuals in the samples (R = 0.91-0.99), although relative species abundances within a mock community sample estimated from sequences were skewed from community composition in terms of the number of individuals or biomass of the species.

Identification of the species origin of pollen has many applications, including assessment of plant-pollinator networks, reconstruction of ancient plant communities, product authentication, allergen monitoring, and forensics. Such applications, however, have previously been limited by microscopy-based identification of pollen, which is slow, has low taxonomic resolution, and has few expert practitioners. One alternative is pollen DNA barcoding, which could overcome these issues. Recent studies demonstrate that both chloroplast and nuclear barcoding markers can be amplified from pollen. These recent validations of pollen metabarcoding indicate that now is the time for researchers in various fields to consider applying these methods to their research programs.

Three distinct communities from South Pacific, Mediterranean, and Southern Ocean waters were identified that share a substantial percentage of ribotypes within them.

Background: In spite of their ecological importance as primary producers and microbioeroders of marine calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) substrata, endolithic phototrophs spanning both prokaryotic (the cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic algae lack established molecular resources for their facilitated survey with high throughput sequencing. Here, the development of a metabarcoding framework for the elongation factor EF-Ttu (tufA) was tested on four Illumina-sequenced marine CaCO 3 microfloras for the characterization of their endolithic phototrophs, especially the abundant bioeroding Ostreobium spp. (Ulvophyceae). The framework consists of novel tufA degenerate primers and a comprehensive database enabling Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) identification at multiple taxonomic ranks with percent identity thresholds determined herein. Results: The newly established tufA database comprises 4057 non-redundant sequences (from 1339 eukaryotic and prokaryotic phototrophs, and 2718 prokaryotic heterotrophs) including 27 classes in 10 phyla of phototrophic diversity summarized from data mining on GenBank ® , our barcoding of >150 clones produced from coral reef microfloras, and >300 eukaryotic phototrophs (>230 Ulvophyceae including >100 'Ostreobium' spp., and >70 Florideophyceae, Phaeophyceae and miscellaneous taxa). Illumina metabarcoding with the newly designed primers resulted in 802 robust OTUs including 618 phototrophs and 184 heterotrophs (77 and 23 % of OTUs, respectively). Phototrophic OTUs belonged to 14 classes of phototrophs found in seven phyla, and represented ~98 % of all reads. The phylogenetic profiles of coral reef microfloras showed few OTUs in large abundance (proportion of reads) for the Chlorophyta (Ulvophyceae, i.e. Ostreobium and Phaeophila), the Rhodophyta (Florideophyceae) and Haptophyta (Coccolithophyceae), and a large diversity (richness) of OTUs in lower abundance for the Cyanophyta (Cyanophyceae) and the Ochrophyta (the diatoms, 'Bacillariophyta'). The bioerosive 'Ostreobium' spp. represented four families in a large clade of subordinal divergence, i.e. the Ostreobidineae, and a fifth, phylogenetically remote family in the suborder Halimedineae (provisionally assigned as the 'Pseudostreobiaceae'). Together they harbor 85-95 delimited cryptic species of endolithic microsiphons. Conclusions: The novel degenerate primers allowed for amplification of endolithic phototrophs across a wide phylogenetic breadth as well as their recovery in very large proportions of reads (overall 98 %) and diversity (overall 77 % of OTUs). The established companion tufA database and determined identity thresholds allow for OTU identification at multiple taxonomic ranks to facilitate the monitoring of phototrophic assemblages via metabarcoding, especially endolithic communities rich in bioeroding Ulvophyceae, such as those harboring 'Ostreobium' spp., Phaeophila spp. and associated algal diversity.","21","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Algae | Amplicon Metagenomics | Bryopsidales | Calcium carbonate | Coral reef | Illumina MiSeq | Metabarcoding | Next generation sequencing | Ostreobium | Phaeophila | Phototrophs | Plastid | Rhodoliths | tufA | Ulvophyceae","13115","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","994","16","1","26965054","8",NA,NA,2016

Many species of fungi are closely allied with bark beetles, including many tree pathogens, but their species richness and patterns of distribution remain largely unknown. We established a protocol for metabarcoding of fungal communities directly from total genomic DNA extracted from individual beetles, showing that the ITS3/4 primer pair selectively amplifies the fungal ITS. Using three specimens of bark beetle from different species, we assess the fungal diversity associated with these specimens and the repeatability of these estimates in PCRs conducted with different primer tags. The combined replicates produced 727 fungal Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for the specimen of Hylastes ater, 435 OTUs for Tomicus piniperda, and 294 OTUs for Trypodendron lineatum, while individual PCR reactions produced on average only 229, 54, and 31 OTUs for the three specimens, respectively. Yet, communities from PCR replicates were very similar in pairwise comparisons, in particular when considering species abundance, but differed greatly among the three beetle specimens. Different primer tags or the inclusion of amplicons in separate libraries did not impact the species composition. The ITS2 sequences were identified with the Lowest Common Ancestor approach and correspond to diverse lineages of fungi, including Ophiostomaceae and Leotiomycetes widely found to be tree pathogens. We conclude that Illumina MiSeq metabarcoding reliably captures fungal diversity associated with bark beetles, although numerous PCR replicates are recommended for an exhaustive sample.

In this study, detailed investigations into 18S-rRNA were carried out; we investigated the effective number of sequences deposited in international nucleotide sequence databases (INSDs), the amplification bias, and the amplicon sequence variability among the three variable regions, V1-3, V4-5 and V7-9, using in silico polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification based on INSDs. We also examined the primer universality and the taxonomic identification power, using MPS-based environmental surveys in the Sea of Okhotsk, to determine which region is more useful for MPS-based monitoring. The primer universality was not significantly different among the three regions, but the number of sequences deposited in INSDs was markedly larger for the V4-5 region than for the other two regions. The sequence variability was significantly different, with the highest variability in the V1-3 region, followed by the V7-9 region, and the lowest variability in the V4-5 region. The results of the MPS-based environmental surveys showed significantly higher identification power in the V1-3 and V7-9 regions than in the V4-5 region, but no significant difference was detected between the V1-3 and V7-9 regions. We therefore conclude that the V1-3 region will be the most suitable for future MPS-based monitoring of natural eukaryote communities, as the number of sequences deposited in INSDs increases.","14","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Identification power | Marine eukaryote | Metabarcoding | MPS-based environmental surveys | Operational taxonomic units","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1001","16","2","26309223",NA,NA,NA,2016

It is possible that variation may also exist between genders in the use of different prey types. However, until recently this idea was difficult to test owing to poorly resolved taxonomy of dietary studies. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing to describe gender-related variation in diet composition of the European free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis), while controlling for effects of age and season. We analysed guano pellets collected from 143 individuals mist-netted from April to October 2012 and 2013, in northeast Portugal. Moths (Lepidoptera; mainly Noctuidae and Geometridae) were by far the most frequently recorded prey, occurring in nearly all samples and accounting for 96 out of 115 prey taxa. There were significant dietary differences between males and females, irrespective of age and season. Compared to males, females tended to consume larger moths and more moths of migratory behaviour (e.g. Autographa gamma). Our study provides the first example of gender-related dietary variation in bats, illustrating the value of novel molecular tools for revealing intraspecific variation in food resource use in bats and other insectivores.","22","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Bat diet | COI | Gender segregation | Metabarcoding | Resource partitioning | Tadarida teniotis","145678","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1002","12","3","27009885","20150988",NA,NA,2016

Pollen can be a critical forensic marker in cases where determining geographic origin is important, including investigative leads, missing persons cases, and intelligence applications. However, its use has previously been limited by the need for a high level of specialization by expert palynologists, slow speeds of identification, and relatively poor taxonomic resolution (typically to the plant family or genus level). By contrast, identification of pollen through DNA barcoding has the potential to overcome all three of these limitations, and it may seem surprising that the method has not been widely implemented. Despite what might seem a straightforward application of DNA barcoding to pollen, there are technical issues that have delayed progress. However, recent developments of standard methods for DNA barcoding of pollen, along with improvements in high-throughput sequencing technology, have overcome most of these technical issues. Based on these recent methodological developments in pollen DNA barcoding, we believe that now is the time to start applying these techniques in forensic palynology. In this article, we discuss the potential for these methods, and outline directions for future research to further improve on the technology and increase its applicability to a broader range of situations.","23","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","DNA barcoding | DNA metabarcoding | Forensic botany | Forensic palynology | High-throughput sequencing | Metagenomics","5700191205","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1003","21",NA,"26751251",NA,NA,"S187249731530106X",2016

A marine symbiosis has been recently discovered between prymnesiophyte species and the unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacterium UCYN-A. At least two different UCYN-A phylotypes exist, the clade UCYN-A1 in symbiosis with an uncultured small prymnesiophyte and the clade UCYN-A2 in symbiosis with the larger Braarudosphaera bigelowii. We targeted the prymnesiophyte-UCYN-A1 symbiosis by double CARD-FISH (catalyzed reporter deposition-fluorescence in situ hybridization) and analyzed its abundance in surface samples from the MALASPINA circumnavigation expedition. Our use of a specific probe for the prymnesiophyte partner allowed us to verify that this algal species virtually always carried the UCYN-A symbiont, indicating that the association was also obligate for the host. The prymnesiophyte-UCYN-A1 symbiosis was detected in all ocean basins, displaying a patchy distribution with abundances (up to 500 cells ml -1) that could vary orders of magnitude. Additional vertical profiles taken at the NE Atlantic showed that this symbiosis occupied the upper water column and disappeared towards the Deep Chlorophyll Maximum, where the biomass of the prymnesiophyte assemblage peaked. Moreover, sequences of both prymnesiophyte partners were searched within a large 18S rDNA metabarcoding data set from the Tara-Oceans expedition around the world. This sequence-based analysis supported the patchy distribution of the UCYN-A1 host observed by CARD-FISH and highlighted an unexpected homogeneous distribution (at low relative abundance) of B. bigelowii in the open ocean. Our results demonstrate that partners are always in symbiosis in nature and show contrasted ecological patterns of the two related lineages.","29","Journal","ar","Article","100","10",NA,"5800173382","BES-2009-027194","Academia Mexicana de Ciencias","1","TRUE","1004","10","3","26405830",NA,NA,NA,2016

In this study, we tested whether an environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approach, using water samples, can be used for addressing significant questions in ecology and conservation. Two key aquatic vertebrate groups were targeted: amphibians and bony fish. The reliability of this method was cautiously validated in silico, in vitro and in situ. When compared with traditional surveys or historical data, eDNA metabarcoding showed a much better detection probability overall. For amphibians, the detection probability with eDNA metabarcoding was 0.97 (CI = 0.90-0.99) vs. 0.58 (CI = 0.50-0.63) for traditional surveys. For fish, in 89% of the studied sites, the number of taxa detected using the eDNA metabarcoding approach was higher or identical to the number detected using traditional methods.

We developed a DNA metabarcoding approach to identify the major eukaryote groups directly from soil with roughly species-level resolution. Using this method, we examined the effects of tree diversity and individual tree species on soil microbial biomass and taxonomic richness of soil biota in two experimental study systems in Finland and Estonia and accounted for edaphic variables and spatial autocorrelation. Our analyses revealed that the effects of tree diversity and individual species on soil biota are largely context dependent. Multiple regression and structural equation modelling suggested that biomass, soil pH, nutrients and tree species directly affect richness of different taxonomic groups.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) refers to the genetic material that can be extracted from bulk environmental samples such as soil, water, and even air. The rapidly expanding study of eDNA has generated unprecedented ability to detect species and conduct genetic analyses for conservation, management, and research, particularly in scenarios where collection of whole organisms is impractical or impossible. While the number of studies demonstrating successful eDNA detection has increased rapidly in recent years, less research has explored the “ecology” of eDNA—myriad interactions between extraorganismal genetic material and its environment—and its influence on eDNA detection, quantification, analysis, and application to conservation and research. Here, we outline a framework for understanding the ecology of eDNA, including the origin, state, transport, and fate of extraorganismal genetic material. Using this framework, we review and synthesize the findings of eDNA studies from diverse environments, taxa, and fields of study to highlight important concepts and knowledge gaps in eDNA study and application. Additionally, we identify frontiers of conservation-focused eDNA application where we see the most potential for growth, including the use of eDNA for estimating population size, population genetic and genomic analyses via eDNA, inclusion of other indicator biomolecules such as environmental RNA or proteins, automated sample collection and analysis, and consideration of an expanded array of creative environmental samples. We discuss how a more complete understanding of the ecology of eDNA is integral to advancing these frontiers and maximizing the potential of future eDNA applications in conservation and research.","137","Journal","re","Review","100","2","Environmental DNA | Metabarcoding | Metagenetics | Metagenomics | Monitoring | Surveillance","22069","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1010","17","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

Background Metabarcoding is becoming a common tool used to assess and compare diversity of organisms in environmental samples. Identification of OTUs is one of the critical steps in the process and several taxonomy assignment methods were proposed to accomplish this task. This publication evaluates the quality of reference datasets, alongside with several alignment and phylogeny inference methods used in one of the taxonomy assignment methods, called tree-based approach. This approach assigns anonymous OTUs to taxonomic categories based on relative placements of OTUs and reference sequences on the cladogram and support that these placements receive. New information In tree-based taxonomy assignment approach, reliable identification of anonymous OTUs is based on their placement in monophyletic and highly supported clades together with identified reference taxa. Therefore, it requires high quality reference dataset to be used. Resolution of phylogenetic trees is strongly affected by the presence of erroneous sequences as well as alignment and phylogeny inference methods used in the process. Two preparation steps are essential for the successful application of tree-based taxonomy assignment approach. 1. Curated collections of genetic information do include erroneous sequences. These sequences have detrimental effect on the resolution of cladograms used in treebased approach. They must be identified and excluded from the reference dataset beforehand. 2. Various combinations of multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny inference methods provide cladograms with different topology and bootstrap support. These combinations of methods need to be tested in order to determine the one that gives highest resolution for the particular reference dataset.

The combination of DNA barcoding and high-throughput (next-generation) sequencing (metabarcoding) provides many promises but also serious challenges. Generating a reliable comparable estimate of biodiversity remains a central challenge to the application of the technology. Many approaches have been used to turn millions of sequences into distinct taxonomic units. However, the extent to which these methods impact the outcome of simple ecological analyses is not well understood. Here we performed a simple analysis of dietary overlap by skinks and shrews on Ile Aux Aigrettes, Mauritius. We used a combination of filtering thresholds and clustering algorithms on a COI metabarcoding dataset and demonstrate that all bioinformatics parameters will have interacting effects on molecular operational taxonomic unit (MOTU) recovery rates. These effects generated estimates covering two orders of magnitude. However, the effect on a simple ecological analysis was not large and, despite the wide variation in estimates of niche overlap, the same ecological conclusion was drawn in most cases.

Food availability and diet selection are important factors influencing the abundance and distribution of wild waterbirds. In order to better understand changes in waterbird population, it is essential to figure out what they feed on. However, analyzing their diet could be difficult and inefficient using traditional methods such as microhistologic observation. Here, we addressed this gap of knowledge by investigating the diet of greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons and bean goose Anser fabalis, which are obligate herbivores wintering in China, mostly in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River floodplain. First, we selected a suitable and high-resolution marker gene for wetland plants that these geese would consume during the wintering period. Eight candidate genes were included: rbcL, rpoC1, rpoB, matK, trnH-psbA, trnL (UAA), atpF-atpH, and psbK-psbI. The selection was performed via analysis of representative sequences from NCBI and comparison of amplification efficiency and resolution power of plant samples collected from the wintering area. The trnL gene was chosen at last with c/h primers, and a local plant reference library was constructed with this gene. Then, utilizing DNA metabarcoding, we discovered 15 food items in total from the feces of these birds. Of the 15 unique dietary sequences, 10 could be identified at specie level. As for greater white-fronted goose, 73% of sequences belonged to Poaceae spp., and 26% belonged to Carex spp. In contrast, almost all sequences of bean goose belonged to Carex spp. (99%). Using the same samples, microhistology provided consistent food composition with metabarcoding results for greater white-fronted goose, while 13% of Poaceae was recovered for bean goose. In addition, two other taxa were discovered only through microhistologic analysis. Although most of the identified taxa matched relatively well between the two methods, DNA metabarcoding gave taxonomically more detailed information. Discrepancies were likely due to biased PCRamplification in metabarcoding, low discriminating power of current marker genes for monocots, and biases in microhistologic analysis. The diet differences between two geese species might indicate deeper ecological significance beyond the scope of this study. We concluded that DNA metabarcoding provides new perspectives for studies of herbivorous waterbird diets and inter-specific interactions, as well as new possibilities to investigate interactions between herbivores and plants. In addition, microhistologic analysis should be used together with metabarcoding methods to integrate this information.","3","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Bean goose | Diet analysis | Greater white-fronted goose | Metabarcoding | Molecular reference library | trnL","21100239256","SKLURE2013-1-05","Chinese Academy of Sciences","1","TRUE","1015","2016","8",NA,"e2345",NA,NA,2016

DNA metabarcoding which couples DNA barcoding with high-throughput sequencing technology enables quick and easy identification of species in a multiple sample, and has become a reliable method for surveying species composition and richness of a community. Taibai Mountain is the main peak of the Qinling Mountains. It is a well-preserved natural ecological system, and is a key area of biodiversity protection in China. Surveys on the diversity of soil meso-microanimals in Taibai Mountain will enrich the data of soil fauna composition and provide scientific basis for biodiversity protection in China. In this paper, we used the metabarcoding approach to analyze the diversity of soil meso-microanimals in 5 different habitats of Taibai Mountain in the Qinling Mountains. These habitats include alpine meadow, coniferous forest, deciduous small-leaved forest, deciduous broad-leaved forest, and farmland. We set 3 plots of 10 m × 10 m in each habitat, and 3 soil samples were collected randomly from each plot, the sampling depth was 0-15cm under ground. A Tullgren funnel was used to separate soil animals from soil samples. Soil animals from the same plot were transferred to 1.5-mL centrifuge tubes and the total DNA was extracted. The universal primers for the fraction of 18S rRNA and COI genes were used to amplify specific barcoding sequences. Sequencing of PCR amplicons was performed on a MiSeq Illumina sequencing platform. Raw data was analyzed using the Qiime and Mothur software to obtain the OTUs list and species list. Ecological analysis was performed using software R. A total of 199 families from 28 orders, 9 classes, and 3 phyla for soil animals were observed. Community composition analysis showed that habitat changes have some effect on the soil animal community composition. Alpha diversit y analysis showed that the highest community richness index for soil animals is the coniferous forest and the lowest is the farmland; in addition, the highest community diversity index for soil animals is the coniferous forest and the lowest is the deciduous small-leaved forest. The community similarity analysis showed that the soil animal community composition in alpine meadow, coniferous forest, and farmland has a high similarity. The soil animal community composition in deciduous small-leaved forest and deciduous broad-leaved forest greatly differed from that in alpine meadow, coniferous forest, and farmland. The difference between the soil animal community composition in deciduous small-leaved forest and deciduous broad-leaved forest also differed greatly. The results of cluster analysis was in conformity with the community similarity analysis.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","Biodiversity | DNA metabarcoding | Soil animals | Taibai mountain","130109","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1017","36","14",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the methods for studying microbial ecology by enabling high-resolution community profiling. However, the use of these technologies in unraveling the plant microbiome remains challenging. Many bacterial 16S rDNA primer pairs also exhibit high affinity for non-target DNA such as plastid (mostly chloroplast) DNA and mitochondrial DNA. Therefore, we experimentally tested a series of commonly used primers for the analysis of plant-associated bacterial communities using 454 pyrosequencing. We evaluated the performance of all selected primer pairs in the study of the bacterial microbiomes present in the rhizosphere soil, root, stem and leaf endosphere of field-grown poplar trees (Populus tremula × Populus alba) based on (a) co-amplification of non-target DNA, (b) low amplification efficiency for pure chloroplast DNA (real-time PCR), (c) high retrieval of bacterial 16S rDNA, (d) high operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness and Inverse Simpson diversity and (e) taxonomic assignment of reads. Results indicate that experimental evaluation of primers provide valuable information that could contribute in the selection of suitable primer pairs for 16S rDNA metabarcoding studies in plant-microbiota research.

Cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) is a powerful marker forDNAbarcoding of animals, with good taxonomic resolution and a large reference database.

Therefore, we explored the ability of the 16S ribosomal DNA gene as an alternative metabarcoding marker for species level assessments. Ten bulk samples, each containing equal amounts of tissue from 52 freshwater invertebrate taxa, were sequenced with the Illumina NextSeq 500 system. The 16S primers amplified three more insect species than the Folmer COI primers and amplified more equally, probably due to decreased primer bias. Estimation of biomass might be less biased with 16S than with COI, although variation in read abundances of two orders of magnitudes is still observed. According to these results, the marker choice depends on the scientific question. If the goal is to obtain a taxonomic identification at the species level, then COI is more appropriate due to established reference databases and known taxonomic resolution of this marker, knowing that a greater proportion of insects will be missed using COI Folmer primers. If the goal is to obtain a more comprehensive survey the 16S marker, which requires building a local reference database, or optimised degenerated COI primers could be more appropriate.","32","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Biodiversity assessment | DNA metabarcoding | Freshwater invertebrates | High throughput sequencing | Illumina sequencing | Method testing | Primer bias | Small ribosomal subunit | Stream ecosystems | Stream monitoring","21100239256","ANR-13-ECOT-0002-01","Agence Nationale de la Recherche","1","TRUE","1019","2016","4",NA,"e1966",NA,NA,2016

Traditional aquatic bioassessment that relies on capture of organisms via nets, traps and electrofishing gear typically has low detection probabilities for rare species and can injure individuals of protected species. Our objective was to determine whether environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling and metabarcoding analysis can be used to accurately measure species diversity in aquatic assemblages with differing structures. We manipulated the density and relative abundance of eight fish and one amphibian species in replicated 206-L mesocosms. Environmental DNA was filtered from water samples, and six mitochondrial gene fragments were Illumina-sequenced to measure species diversity in each mesocosm. Metabarcoding detected all nine species in all treatment replicates. Additionally, we found a modest, but positive relationship between species abundance and sequencing read abundance.

The rapid growth of the salmon industry necessitates the development of fast and accurate tools to assess its environmental impact. Macrobenthic monitoring is commonly used to measure the impact of organic enrichment associated with salmon farm activities. However, classical benthic monitoring can hardly answer the rapidly growing demand because the morphological identification of macro-invertebrates is time-consuming, expensive and requires taxonomic expertise. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of meiofauna-sized organisms, such as Foraminifera, was proposed to overcome the drawbacks of macrofauna-based benthic monitoring. Here, we tested the application of foraminiferal metabarcoding to benthic monitoring of salmon farms in Norway. We analysed 140 samples of eDNA and environmental RNA (eRNA) extracted from surface sediment samples collected at 4 salmon farming sites in Norway. We sequenced the variable region 37f of the 18S rRNA gene specific to Foraminifera. We compared our data to the results of macrofaunal surveys of the same sites and tested the congruence between various diversity indices inferred from metabarcoding and morphological data. The results of our study confirm the usefulness of Foraminifera as bioindicators of organic enrichment associated with salmon farming. The foraminiferal diversity increased with the distance to fish cages, and metabarcoding provides an assessment of the ecological quality comparable to the morphological analyses. The foraminiferal metabarcoding approach appears to be a promising alternative to classical benthic monitoring, providing a solution to the morpho-taxonomic bottleneck of macrofaunal surveys.","16","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Biomonitoring | DNA barcoding | Environmental DNA | Finfish farming | Foraminifera | Next-generation sequencing | NGS","21100198493","316030_150817","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung","1","TRUE","1023","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

Characterization of biodiversity has been extensively used to confidently monitor and assess environmental status. Yet, visual morphology, traditionally and widely used for species identification in coastal and marine ecosystem communities, is tedious and entails limitations. Metabarcoding coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) represents an alternative to rapidly, accurately, and cost-effectively analyze thousands of environmental samples simultaneously, and this method is increasingly used to characterize the metazoan taxonomic composition of a wide variety of environments. However, a comprehensive study benchmarking visual and metabarcoding-based taxonomic inferences that validates this technique for environmental monitoring is still lacking. Here, we compare taxonomic inferences of benthic macroinvertebrate samples of known taxonomic composition obtained using alternative metabarcoding protocols based on a combination of different DNA sources, barcodes of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene and amplification conditions. Our results highlight the influence of the metabarcoding protocol in the obtained taxonomic composition and suggest the better performance of an alternative 313 bp length barcode to the traditionally 658 bp length one used for metazoan metabarcoding. Additionally, we show that a biotic index inferred from the list of macroinvertebrate taxa obtained using DNA-based taxonomic assignments is comparable to that inferred using morphological identification. Thus, our analyses prove metabarcoding valid for environmental status assessment and will contribute to accelerating the implementation of this technique to regular monitoring programs.","47","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","AMBI | Biotic indices | COI barcodes | Extracellular DNA | Illumina MiSeq | Macroinvertebrates","21100790929","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1024","3","JUN",NA,"96",NA,NA,2016

We developed a cost-effective metabarcoding strategy to analyze phytoplankton community structure using the Illumina MiSeq system. The amplicons (404-411 bp) obtained by end-pairing of two reads were sufficiently long to distinguish algal species and provided barcode data equivalent to those generated with the Roche 454 system, but at less than 1/20th of the cost. The original universal primer sequences targeting the 23S rDNA region and the PCR strategy were both modified, and this resulted in higher numbers of eukaryotic algal sequences by excluding non-photosynthetic proteobacterial sequences supporting effectiveness of this strategy. The novel strategy was used to analyze the phytoplankton community structure of six water samples from the East/Japan Sea: Surface and 50 m depths at coastal and open-sea sites, with collections in May and July 2014. In total, 345 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, which covered most of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic algal phyla, including Dinophyta, Rhodophyta, Ochrophyta, Chlorophyta, Streptophyta, Cryptophyta, Haptophyta, and Cyanophyta. This highlights the importance of plastid 23S primers, which perform better than the currently used 16S primers for phytoplankton community surveys. The findings also revealed that more efforts should be made to update 23S rDNA sequences as well as those of 16S in the databases. Analysis of algal proportions in the six samples showed that community structure differed depending on location, depth and season. Across the six samples evaluated, the numbers of OTUs in each phylum were similar but their relative proportions varied. This novel strategy would allow laboratories to analyze large numbers of samples at reasonable expense, whereas this has not been possible to date due to cost and time. In addition, we expect that this strategy will generate a large amount of novel data that could potentially change established methods and tools that are currently used in the realms of oceanography and marine ecology.","10","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Barcode | Genomics | Next-generation sequencing | Oceanography | Phytoplankton","21100239256","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1026","2016","6",NA,"e2115",NA,NA,2016

The intertidal region is one of the most dynamic environments in the biosphere, which potentially supports vast biodiversity. Fungi have been found to play important roles in marine ecosystems, e.g., as parasites or symbionts of plants and animals, and as decomposers of organic materials. The fungal diversity in intertidal region, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, sediment samples from various intertidal habitats of Chinese seas were collected and investigated for determination of fungal community and spatial distribution. Through ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer-2 (ITS2) metabarcoding, a high-level fungal diversity was revealed, as represented by 6,013 OTUs that spanned six phyla, 23 classes, 84 orders and 526 genera. The presence of typical decomposers (e.g., Corollospora in Ascomycota and Lepiota in Basidiomycota) and pathogens (e.g., Olpidium in Chytriomycota, Actinomucor in Zygomycota and unidentified Rozellomycota spp.), and even mycorrhizal fungi (e.g., Glomus in Glomeromycota) indicated a complicated origin of intertidal fungi. Interestingly, a small proportion of sequences were classified to obligate marine fungi (e.g., Corollospora, Lignincola, Remispora, Sigmoidea). Our data also showed that the East China Sea significantly differed from other regions in terms of species richness and community composition, indicating a profound effect of the huge discharge of the Yangtze River. No significant difference in fungal communities was detected, however, among habitat types (i.e., aquaculture, dock, plant, river mouth and tourism). These observations raise further questions on adaptation of these members to environments and the ecological functions they probably perform.","8","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Distribution pattern | Fungal community | Intertidal region | Metabarcoding | Microbiome","21100226442","153211 KYSB 20160029","Chinese Academy of Sciences","1","TRUE","1028","7","DEC",NA,"2098",NA,NA,2016

Deep-sea sediments represent the largest but least known ecosystem on earth. With increasing anthropogenic pressure, it is now a matter of urgency to improve our understanding of deep-sea biodiversity. Traditional morpho-taxonomic studies suggest that the ocean floor hosts extraordinarily diverse benthic communities. However, due to both its remoteness and a lack of expert taxonomists, assessing deep-sea diversity is a very challenging task. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding offers a powerful tool to complement morpho-taxonomic studies. Here we use eDNA to assess benthic metazoan diversity in 39 deep-sea sediment samples from bathyal and abyssal depths worldwide. The eDNA dataset was dominated by meiobenthic taxa and we identified all animal phyla commonly found in the deep-sea benthos; yet, the diversity within these phyla remains largely unknown. The large numbers of taxonomically unassigned molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were not equally distributed among phyla, with nematodes and platyhelminthes being the most poorly characterized from a taxonomic perspective. While the data obtained here reveal pronounced heterogeneity and vast amounts of unknown biodiversity in the deep sea, they also expose the difficulties in exploiting metabarcoding datasets resulting from the lack of taxonomic knowledge and appropriate reference databases. Overall, our study demonstrates the promising potential of eDNA metabarcoding to accelerate the assessment of deep-sea biodiversity for pure and applied deep-sea environmental research but also emphasizes the necessity to integrate such new approaches with traditional morphology-based examination of deep-sea organisms.","25","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","18S rDNA | Biodiversity | Environmental DNA | Meiobenthos | Metabarcoding","21100790929","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1029","3","JUN",NA,"92",NA,NA,2016

Among vertebrates, herpetofauna has the highest proportion of declining species. Detection of environmental DNA (eDNA) is a promising method towards significantly increasing large-scale herpetological conservation efforts. However, the integration of eDNA results within a management framework requires an evaluation of the efficiency of the method in large natural environments and the calibration of eDNA surveys with the quantitative monitoring tools currently used by conservation biologists. Towards this end, we first developed species-specific primers to detect the wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) a species at risk in Canada, by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The rate of eDNA detection obtained by qPCR was also compared to the relative abundance of this species in nine rivers obtained by standardized visual surveys in the Province of Québec (Canada). Second, we developed multi-species primers to detect North American amphibian and reptile species using eDNA metabarcoding analysis. An occurrence index based on the distribution range and habitat type was compared with the eDNA metabarcoding dataset from samples collected in seven lakes and five rivers. Our results empirically support the effectiveness of eDNA metabarcoding to characterize herpetological species distributions. Moreover, detection rates provided similar results to standardized visual surveys currently used to develop conservation strategies for the wood turtle. We conclude that eDNA detection rates may provide an effective semiquantitative survey tool, provided that assay calibration and standardization is performed.","13","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Amphibian | EDNA metabarcoding | Monitoring | QPCR | Reptile","22211","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1031","59","11","27788021",NA,NA,NA,2016

All rights reserved. DNA metabarcoding, a technique based on next-generation genetic sequencing, enables the rapid characterization of species composition in bulk biodiversity samples or when analyzing environmental DNA, and thus facilitates comprehensive, large-scale biodiversity assessments and monitoring. The Qinling Mountain range, extending in an east-west direction across central China, includes a series of valleys traversed by mountain streams of various sizes. Although these streams potentially contain an array of aquatic organisms, the complexity of the environment and the presence of small, cryptic, rare, or poorly characterized species makes studying the aquatic biodiversity of these streams a challenge. The goal of this study was to use DNA metabarcoding to examine the composition of both the aquatic fauna and of the aquatic communities as a whole in the Qinling Mountain streams, employing alpha diversity, beta diversity and cluster analyses to evaluate differences in biodiversity from samples collected from different locations. For this purpose, 10 samples containing both zooplankton and zoobenthos were collected from downstream and upstream locations of five streams (Jin Longxia, Shi Bianyu, Feng Yukou, Wutai Mountain and Meridian Valley) in the Qinling Mountains. The cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO I) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) genes were selected as barcoding sequences. Following DNA extractionand PCR amplification using degenerate primers, the amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform, and Qiime and Mothur software were used to analyze the raw data and to obtain an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) list. Ecological analysis was subsequently performed using Excel, R, and Qiime software. Analysis of the fauna composition revealed that a total of 89 orders, from 48 classes, and 10 phyla were identifiable in the total group of samples using the two gene markers. Individually, 52 orders, from 42 classes, and 9 phyla were identified using the 18S rRNA sequences, and 36 orders, from 11 classes, and 5 phyla were identified using the CO I sequences, demonstrating that the two gene markers together resulted in a higher rate of identification than either marker alone. With regard to community composition, analysis of CO I gene sequences revealed that the Arthropod orders Diptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera and Coleoptera were the most common taxa, with lower occurrences of Protozoa and Rotifera. Analysis of community composition using the 18S rRNA gene sequences, on the other hand, indicated three main groups in the samples, namely the Arthropda, Mollusca and Platyhelminthes. Both the fauna composition and community composition analyses showed that the number of groups in the downstream samples was higher than that in the upstream samples. Moreover, alpha diversity analysis revealed that the three sampling plots (Jin Longxia, Shi Bianyu and Feng Yukou) most intensively affected by human activities had relatively high values of community richness and diversity compared with the two more natural sampling plots (Wutai Mountain and Meridian Valley), suggesting that aquatic biodiversity may be improved if a location has a certain degree of external interference. Finally, beta diversity analysis demonstrated that, although community variations may be very obvious when samples collected from different environments are compared, such variations may not be so obvious in samples collected from similar environments, with cluster analysis showing that community similarity values in such samples are relatively high.","0","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","Aquatic animal | Biodiversity | DNA metabarcoding | Qinling Mountains","130109","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1032","36","19",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

However, traditional methods to survey mobile species' distribution and abundance in marine environments are often inefficient, environmentally destructive, or resource-intensive. Metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) offers a new means to assess biodiversity and on much larger scales, but adoption of this approach for surveying whole animal communities in large, dynamic aquatic systems has been slowed by significant unknowns surrounding error rates of detection and relevant spatial resolution of eDNA surveys. Here, we report the results of a 2.5 km eDNA transect surveying the vertebrate fauna present along a gradation of diverse marine habitats associated with a kelp forest ecosystem. Using PCR primers that target the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene of marine fishes and mammals, we generated eDNA sequence data and compared it to simultaneous visual dive surveys. We find spatial concordance between individual species' eDNA and visual survey trends, and that eDNA is able to distinguish vertebrate community assemblages from habitats separated by as little as ~60 m. eDNA reliably detected vertebrates with low false-negative error rates (1/12 taxa) when compared to the surveys, and revealed cryptic species known to occupy the habitats but overlooked by visual methods. This study also presents an explicit accounting of false negatives and positives in metabarcoding data, which illustrate the influence of gene marker selection, replication, contamination, biases impacting eDNA count data and ecology of target species on eDNA detection rates in an open ecosystem.","68","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","biodiversity | eDNA | fish | metabarcoding | monitoring | next generation sequencing","20297","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1034","25","2","26586544",NA,NA,NA,2016

However, the DNA is highly degraded and contains a lower relative proportion of endogenous sequences in bone older than 8400 cal a BP. Furthermore, modelling of DNA degradation suggests that the decay rate is rapid, and predicts a very low probability of obtaining informative aDNA sequences from extinct megafaunal bones from Naracoorte (ca. 50000 cal a BP). We also provide new information regarding the past faunal biodiversity of Robertson Cave, including families that have not been formerly described in the fossil record from here before.

The expanding scale and increasing rate of marine biological invasions have been documented since the early 20th century. Besides their global ecological and economic impacts, nonindigenous species (NIS) also have attracted much attention as opportunities to explore important eco-evolutionary processes such as rapid adaptation, long-distance dispersal and range expansion, and secondary contacts between divergent evolutionary lineages. In this context, genetic tools have been extensively used in the past 20 years. Three important issues appear to have emerged from such studies. First, the study of NIS has revealed unexpected cryptic diversity in what had previously been assumed homogeneous entities. Second, there has been surprisingly little evidence of strong founder events accompanying marine introductions, a pattern possibly driven by large propagule loads. Third, the evolutionary processes leading to successful invasion have been difficult to ascertain due to faint genetic signals. Here we explore the potential of novel tools associated with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) to address these still pressing issues. Dramatic increase in the number of loci accessible via HTS has the potential to radically increase the power of analyses aimed at species delineation, exploring the population genomic consequences of range expansions, and examining evolutionary processes such as admixture, introgression, and adaptation. Nevertheless, the value of this new wealth of genomic data will ultimately depend on the ability to couple it with expanded ""traditional"" efforts, including exhaustive sampling of marine populations over large geographic scales, integrated taxonomic analyses, and population level exploration of quantitative trait differentiation through common-garden and other laboratory experiments.","16","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","Biological invasions | Cryptic species | Cryptogenic species | Eco-evolutionary processes | Genomics | Metabarcoding","17600155124","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1038","62","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016

To implement the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), European Member States are required to improve marine monitoring and design monitoring networks. This can be achieved by developing and testing innovative and cost-effective monitoring systems, as well as indicators of environmental status.

Despite decades of work in environmental science and ecology, estimating human influences on ecosystems remains challenging. This is partly due to complex chains of causation among ecosystem elements, exacerbated by the difficulty of collecting biological data at sufficient spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales. Here, we demonstrate the utility of environmental DNA (eDNA) for quantifying associations between human land use and changes in an adjacent ecosystem. We analyze metazoan eDNA sequences from water sampled in nearshore marine eelgrass communities and assess the relationship between these ecological communities and the degree of urbanization in the surrounding watershed. Counter to conventional wisdom, we find strongly increasing richness and decreasing beta diversity with greater urbanization, and similar trends in the diversity of life histories with urbanization. We also find evidence that urbanization influences nearshore communities at local (hundreds of meters) rather than regional (tens of km) scales. Given that different survey methods sample different components of an ecosystem, we then discuss the advantages of eDNA-which we use here to detect hundreds of taxa simultaneously-as a complement to traditional ecological sampling, particularly in the context of broad ecological assessments where exhaustive manual sampling is impractical. Genetic data are a powerful means of uncovering human- ecosystem interactions that might otherwise remain hidden; nevertheless, no sampling method reveals the whole of a biological community.","19","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Environmental impact assessment | Estuarine | Marine | Metabarcoding | Metagenomics | Molecular ecology","21100239256","2014-39827","David and Lucile Packard Foundation","1","TRUE","1041","2016","9",NA,"e2444",NA,NA,2016

Whilst BBD aetiology has been intensively described worldwide, it remains unclear if corals with apparently similar lesions across coral reefs are affected by the same pathogens.

Microbial plankton form the productive base of both marine and freshwater ecosystems and are key drivers of global biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nutrients. Plankton diversity is immense with representations from all major phyla within the three domains of life. So far, plankton monitoring has mainly been based on microscopic identification, which has limited sensitivity and reproducibility, not least because of the numerical majority of plankton being unidentifiable under the light microscope. High-throughput sequencing of taxonomic marker genes offers a means to identify taxa inaccessible by traditional methods; thus, recent studies have unveiled an extensive previously unknown diversity of plankton. Here, we conducted ultra-deep Illumina sequencing (average 105 sequences/sample) of rRNA gene amplicons of surface water eukaryotic and bacterial plankton communities sampled in summer along a 2000 km transect following the salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea. Community composition was strongly correlated with salinity for both bacterial and eukaryotic plankton assemblages, highlighting the importance of salinity for structuring the biodiversity within this ecosystem. In contrast, no clear trends in alpha-diversity for bacterial or eukaryotic communities could be detected along the transect. The distribution of major planktonic taxa followed expected patterns as observed in monitoring programs, but groups novel to the Baltic Sea were also identified, such as relatives to the coccolithophore Emiliana huxleyi detected in the northern Baltic Sea.

Small and shallow aquatic ecosystems such as ponds and streams constitute a significant proportion of continental surface waters, especially in temperate zones. In comparison with bigger lakes and rivers, they harbor higher biodiversity but they also exhibit reduced buffering capacity face to environmental shifts, such that climate global change can affect them in a more drastic way. For instance, many temperate areas are predicted to undergo droughts with increasing frequency in the near future, which may lead to the temporal desiccation of streams and ponds. In this work, we monitored temporal dynamics of planktonic communities of microbial eukaryotes (cell size range: 0.2-5 µm) in one brook and one pond that experienced recurrent droughts from 1 to 5 consecutive months during a temporal survey carried out monthly for 2 years based on high-throughput 18S rDNA metabarcoding. During drought-induced desiccation events, protist communities present in the remaining dry sediment, though highly diverse, differed radically from their planktonic counterparts. However, after water refill, the aquatic protist assemblages recovered their original structure within a month. This rapid recovery indicates that these eukaryotic communities are resilient to droughts, most likely via the entrance in dormancy. This property is essential for the long-term survival and functional stability of small freshwater ecosystems.","7","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","18S rRNA | Dormancy | Plankton | Protist | Resilience | Temporal dynamics","21100226442","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1044","7","MAY",NA,"812",NA,NA,2016

The skins do not contain cells or DNA themselves, but epithelial cells and other cell-based structures might accidentally attach as they are shed. This source of trace DNA can be sufficient for PCR amplification and sequencing of target genes and aid in species identification through DNA barcoding or association of unknown life stages. Species identification is essential for biomonitoring programs, as species vary in sensitivities to environmental factors. However, it requires a DNA isolation protocol that optimizes the output of target DNA. Here, we compare the relative effectiveness of five different DNA extraction protocols and direct PCR in isolation of DNA from chironomid pupal exuviae. Chironomidae (Diptera) is a species-rich group of aquatic macroinvertebrates widely distributed in freshwater environments and considered a valuable bioindicator of water quality. Genomic DNA was extracted from 61.2% of 570 sampled pupal exuviae. There were significant differences in the methods with regard to cost, handling time, DNA quantity, PCR success, sequence success and the ability to sequence target taxa. The NucleoSpin®Tissue XS Kit, DNeasy®Blood and Tissue kit, and QuickExtract™DNA Extraction Solution provided the best results in isolating DNA from single pupal exuviae. Direct PCR and DTAB/CTAB methods gave poor results. While the observed differences in DNA isolation methods on trace DNA will be relevant to research that focuses on aquatic macroinvertebrate ecology, taxonomy and systematics, they should also be of interest for studies using environmental barcoding and metabarcoding of aquatic environments.","12","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","Aquatic macroinvertebrates | Biodiversity assessment | COI | DNA barcoding | DNA isolation | Species identification","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1045","16","1","26186122",NA,NA,NA,2016

The arc of reception for a new technology or method - like the reception of new information itself - can pass through predictable stages, with audiences' responses evolving from 'I don't believe it', through 'well, maybe' to 'yes, everyone knows that' to, finally, 'old news'. The idea that one can sample a volume of water, sequence DNA out of it, and report what species are living nearby has experienced roughly this series of responses among biologists, beginning with the microbial biologists who developed genetic techniques to reveal the unseen microbiome. 'Macrobial' biologists and ecologists - those accustomed to dealing with species they can see and count - have been slower to adopt such molecular survey techniques, in part because of the uncertain relationship between the number of recovered DNA sequences and the abundance of whole organisms in the sampled environment. In this issue of Molecular Ecology Resources, Evans et al. () quantify this relationship for a suite of nine vertebrate species consisting of eight fish and one amphibian. Having detected all of the species present with a molecular toolbox of six primer sets, they consistently find DNA abundances are associated with species' biomasses. The strength and slope of this association vary for each species and each primer set - further evidence that there is no universal parameter linking recovered DNA to species abundance - but Evans and colleagues take a significant step towards being able to answer the next question audiences tend to ask: 'Yes, but how many are there?'","8","Journal","ar","Article","100","1","Community ecology | Environmental DNA | Mesocosm | Metabarcoding | Species diversity","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1046","16","1","26768195",NA,NA,NA,2016

Introducing of the DNA metabarcoding analysis of probiotic microbial communities allowed getting insight into their functioning and establishing a better control on safety and efficacy of the probiotic communities. In this work the kombucha poly-microbial probiotic community was analysed to study its flexibility under different growth conditions. Environmental DNA sequencing revealed a complex and flexible composition of the kombucha microbial culture (KMC) constituting more bacterial and fungal organisms in addition to those found by cultural method. The community comprised bacterial and yeast components including cultured and uncultivable microorganisms. Culturing the KMC under different conditions revealed the core part of the community which included acetobacteria of two genera Komagataeibacter (former Gluconacetobacter) and Gluconobacter, and representatives of several yeast genera among which Brettanomyces/Dekkera and Pichia (including former Issatchenkia) were dominant. Herbaspirillum spp. and Halomonas spp., which previously had not been described in KMC, were found to be minor but permanent members of the community. The community composition was dependent on the growth conditions. The bacterial component of KMC was relatively stable, but may include additional member—lactobacilli. The yeast species composition was significantly variable. High-throughput sequencing showed complexity and variability of KMC that may affect the quality of the probiotic drink. It was hypothesized that the kombucha core community might recruit some environmental bacteria, particularly lactobacilli, which potentially may contribute to the fermentative capacity of the probiotic drink. As many KMC-associated microorganisms cannot be cultured out of the community, a robust control for community composition should be provided by using DNA metabarcoding.","15","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","Kombucha microbial community | Metabarcoding | Pyrosequencing","21100198481","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1047","5","1",NA,"35",NA,NA,2015

Nematodes inhabiting benthic deep-sea ecosystems account for >90% of the total metazoan abundances and they have been hypothesised to be hyper-diverse, but their biodiversity is still largely unknown. Metabarcoding could facilitate the census of biodiversity, especially for those tiny metazoans for which morphological identification is difficult. We compared, for the first time, different DNA extraction procedures based on the use of two commercial kits and a previously published laboratory protocol and tested their suitability for sequencing analyses of 18S rDNA of marine nematodes. We also investigated the reliability of Roche 454 sequencing analyses for assessing the biodiversity of deep-sea nematode assemblages previously morphologically identified. Finally, intra-genomic variation in 18S rRNA gene repeats was investigated by Illumina MiSeq in different deep-sea nematode morphospecies to assess the influence of polymorphisms on nematode biodiversity estimates. Our results indicate that the two commercial kits should be preferred for the molecular analysis of biodiversity of deep-sea nematodes since they consistently provide amplifiable DNA suitable for sequencing. We report that the morphological identification of deep-sea nematodes matches the results obtained by metabarcoding analysis only at the order-family level and that a large portion of Operational Clustered Taxonomic Units (OCTUs) was not assigned. We also show that independently from the cut-off criteria and bioinformatic pipelines used, the number of OCTUs largely exceeds the number of individuals and that 18S rRNA gene of different morpho-species of nematodes displayed intragenomic polymorphisms. Our results indicate that metabarcoding is an important tool to explore the diversity of deep-sea nematodes, but still fails in identifying most of the species due to limited number of sequences deposited in the public databases, and in providing quantitative data on the species encountered. These aspects should be carefully taken into account before using metabarcoding in quantitative ecological research and monitoring programmes of marine biodiversity.","27","Journal","ar","Article","100","5",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1048","10","12","26701112","e0144928",NA,NA,2015

Metabarcoding, the coupling of DNA-based species identification and high-throughput sequencing, offers enormous promise for arthropod biodiversity studies but factors such as cost, speed and ease-of-use of bioinformatic pipelines, crucial for making the leapt from demonstration studies to a real-world application, have not yet been adequately addressed. Here, four published and one newly designed primer sets were tested across a diverse set of 80 arthropod species, representing 11 orders, to establish optimal protocols for Illumina-based metabarcoding of tropical Malaise trap samples. Two primer sets which showed the highest amplification success with individual specimen polymerase chain reaction (PCR, 98%) were used for bulk PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The sequencing outputs were subjected to both manual and simple metagenomics quality control and filtering pipelines. We obtained acceptable detection rates after bulk PCR and high-throughput sequencing (80-90% of input species) but analyses were complicated by putative heteroplasmic sequences and contamination. The manual pipeline produced similar or better outputs to the simple metagenomics pipeline (1.4 compared with 0.5 expected:unexpected Operational Taxonomic Units). Our study suggests that metabarcoding is slowly becoming as cheap, fast and easy as conventional DNA barcoding, and that Malaise trap metabarcoding may soon fulfill its potential, providing a thermometer for biodiversity.","50","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Arthropoda | biodiversity | COI | high-throughput sequencing | Illumina Miseq | Malaise trap","19704","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1049","105","6","26344799",NA,NA,"S0007485315000681",2015

More than 50 ITS1 sequence types representing at least 15 distinct Phytophthora taxa were detected. Nine had ITS sequences that grouped them in defined taxonomic groups (P. nicotianae, P. citrophthora, P. meadii, P. taxon Pgchlamydo, P. cinnamomi, P. parvispora, P. cambivora, P. niederhauserii and P. lateralis) whereas three phylotypes were associated to two or more taxa (P. citricola taxon E or III; P. pseudosyringae, P. ilicis or P. nemorosa; and P. cryptogea, P. erythroseptica, P. himalayensis or P. sp.

Technological advances have enabled a new class of multivariate models for ecology, with the potential now to specify a statistical model for abundances jointly across many taxa, to simultaneously explore interactions across taxa and the response of abundance to environmental variables. Joint models can be used for several purposes of interest to ecologists, including estimating patterns of residual correlation across taxa, ordination, multivariate inference about environmental effects and environment-by-trait interactions, accounting for missing predictors, and improving predictions in situations where one can leverage knowledge of some species to predict others. We demonstrate this by example and discuss recent computation tools and future directions. Many ecological questions require the joint analysis of abundances collected simultaneously across many taxonomic groups, and, if organisms are identified using modern tools such as metabarcoding, their number can be in the thousands.While historically such data have been analyzed using ad hoc algorithms, it is now possible to fully specify joint statistical models for abundance using multivariate extensions of generalized linear mixed models.These modern 'joint modeling' approaches allow the study of correlation patterns across taxa, at the same time as studying environmental response, to tease the two apart.Latent variable models are an especially exciting tool that has recently been used for ordination as well as for studying the factors driving co-occurrence.","148","Journal","re","Review","100","7",NA,"14365","251965","Academy of Finland","0","FALSE","1051","30","12","26519235",NA,NA,"S0169534715002402",2015

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods applied to soil fungi provide the opportunity to unveil the most inconspicuous functional guilds (e.g. saprobes) and life forms (e.g. Corticiaceae) of this tremendous diversity. We used fruitbody surveys over 2 years and soil 454 metabarcoding in Castanea sativa orchards to evaluate respectively the reproductive (fruitbodies) and vegetative (mycelia) parts of fungal communities in three 100-year-old stands. Analysis of 839 fruitbodies and 210291 ITS1 reads revealed high fungal diversity, mainly shown by belowground analysis, with high (dominant) abundance of mycorrhizal fruitbodies and reads. Both methods displayed contrasted composition and structure of fungal communities, with Basidio- and Ascomycetes dominating above- and belowground, respectively. For the two dominant fungal guilds (i.e. ectomycorrhizal and saprobic), diversity above- and belowground overlapped weakly. This study is the first assessment of the complementarity of fruitbody surveys and NGS for analysing fungal diversity in Mediterranean ecosystems and shows that belowground methods still need to be completed by fruiting diversity to provide a comprehensive overview of the different fungal guilds.

Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is a framework for managing marine re - sources. EBM strategies can be evaluated with ecosystem models that represent functional components of ecosystems, including anthropogenic factors. Foodwebs are at the core of ecosystem models, but because dietary data can be difficult to obtain, they are often coarsely characterised. High-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) of diets is a rapid way to parameterise foodwebs at enhanced taxonomic resolution, and potentially, to optimise the functioning of ecosystem models. We evaluated the relative merits of microscopic and HTS analyses of the diets of 8 fish species harvested in Australia's most intensive fishery, viz. The southeast trawl fishery. We compare the taxonomic resolution and phylogenetic breadth of diets yielded by these methods and include a comparison of 3 DNA barcoding markers (mtDNA COX1 Minibar, mtDNA 16S Chord-cephA, nDNA 18S Bilateria). Using paired individual gut samples (n = 151), we demonstrate that HTS typically identified similar taxon richness but at significantly higher taxonomic resolution than microscopy. However, DNA barcode selection significantly affected both the resolution and phylogenetic breadth of estimated diets. Both COX1 Minibar and 16S Chord-cephA barcodes provided higher taxonomic resolution than morphological analysis, but the resolution varied between taxonomic groups primarily due to availabilities of reference data. However, neither barcode recovered the full dietary spectrum revealed by the 18S Bilateria barcode. HTS also revealed the presence of dietary items not previously recorded for target species, and diverse parasite assemblages. We conclude that HTS has the potential to improve structure and function of ecosystem models and to facilitate best-practice EBM.","26","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","DNA sequencing | Ecosystem modelling | Ecosystem-based management | Fisheries management | Foodweb","12169","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1054","540",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2015

Yet accurate predictions of the effects of climatic warming on herbivores are limited by a poor understanding of how herbivore diet varies along climate gradients. We utilized DNA metabarcoding to reconstruct seasonal variation in the diet of North American bison (Bison bison) in two grasslands that differ in mean annual temperature by 6 °C. Here, we show that associated with greater nutritional stress in warmer climates, bison consistently consumed fewer graminoids and more shrubs and forbs, i.e. eudicots. Bison in the warmer grassland consumed a lower proportion of C 3 grass, but not a greater proportion of C 4 grass. Instead, bison diet in the warmer grassland had a greater proportion of N 2 -fixing eudicots, regularly comprising >60% of their protein intake in spring and fall. Although bison have been considered strict grazers, as climatic warming reduces grass protein concentrations, bison may have to attempt to compensate by grazing less and browsing more. Promotion of high-protein, palatable eudicots or increasing the protein concentrations of grasses will be critical to minimizing warming-imposed nutritional stress for bison and perhaps other large mammalian herbivores.","14","Journal","ar","Article","100","4",NA,"21100200805","undefined","Nature Conservancy of Canada","1","TRUE","1055","5",NA,"26567987","16738",NA,NA,2015

When pooled for extraction as a bulk sample, the DNA within morphologically unidentifiable fossil bones can, using next-generation sequencing, yield valuable taxonomic data. This method has been proposed as a means to rapidly and cost-effectively assess general ancient DNA preservation at a site, and to investigate temporal and spatial changes in biodiversity; however, several caveats have yet to be considered. We critically evaluated the bulk bone metabarcoding (BBM) method in terms of its: (i) repeatability, by quantifying sampling and technical variance through a nested experimental design containing sub-samples and replicates at several stages; (ii) accuracy, by comparing morphological and molecular family-level identifications; and (iii) overall utility, by applying the approach to two independent Holocene fossil deposits, Bat Cave (Kangaroo Island, Australia) and Finsch's Folly (Canterbury, New Zealand). For both sites, bone and bone powder sub-sampling were found to contribute significantly to variance in molecularly identified family assemblage, while the contribution of library preparation and sequencing was almost negligible. Nevertheless, total variance was small. Sampling over 80% fewer bones than was required to morphologically identify the taxonomic assemblages, we found that the families identified molecularly are a subset of the families identified morphologically and, for the most part, represent the most abundant families in the fossil record. In addition, we detected a range of extinct, extant and endangered taxa, including some that are rare in the fossil record. Given the relatively low sampling effort of the BBM approach compared with morphological approaches, these results suggest that BBM is largely consistent, accurate, sensitive, and therefore widely applicable. Furthermore, we assessed the overall benefits and caveats of the method, and suggest a workflow for palaeontologists, archaeologists, and geneticists that will help mitigate these caveats. Our results show that DNA analysis of bulk bone samples can be a universally useful tool for studying past biodiversity, when integrated with existing morphology-based approaches. Despite several limitations that remain, the BBM method offers a cost-effective and efficient way of studying fossil assemblages, offering complementary insights into evolution, extinction, and conservation.","17","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","ADNA | Ancient DNA | Archaeology | Biodiversity | Bulk bone | Experimental error | Fossil | Metabarcoding | Next-generation sequencing | Palaeontology","26239","DP120104435","Australian Research Council","0","FALSE","1057","128",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0277379115301116",2015

Background Substantial progress in high-throughput metagenomic sequencing methodologies has enabled the characterisation of bacteria from various origins (for example gut and skin). However, the recently-discovered bacterial microbiota present within animal internal tissues has remained unexplored due to technical difficulties associated with these challenging samples. Results We have optimized a specific 16S rDNA-targeted metagenomics sequencing (16S metabarcoding) pipeline based on the Illumina MiSeq technology for the analysis of bacterial DNA in human and animal tissues. This was successfully achieved in various mouse tissues despite the high abundance of eukaryotic DNA and PCR inhibitors in these samples. We extensively tested this pipeline on mock communities, negative controls, positive controls and tissues and demonstrated the presence of novel tissue specific bacterial DNA profiles in a variety of organs (including brain, muscle, adipose tissue, liver and heart). Conclusion The high throughput and excellent reproducibility of the method ensured exhaustive and precise coverage of the 16S rDNA bacterial variants present in mouse tissues. This optimized 16S metagenomic sequencing pipeline will allow the scientific community to catalogue the bacterial DNA profiles of different tissues and will provide a database to analyse host/bacterial interactions in relation to homeostasis and disease.","37","Journal","ar","Article","100","13",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1059","10","11","26544955","e0142334",NA,NA,2015

The “niche variation hypothesis” (NVH) predicts that populations with wider niches should display higher among-individual variability. This prediction originally stated at the intra-specific level may be extended to the inter-specific level: individuals of generalist species may differ to a greater extent than individuals of a specialist species. We tested the NVH at intra- and inter-specific levels based on a large diet database of three large herbivore feces collected in the field and analyzed using DNA metabarcoding. The three herbivores (roe deer Capreolus capreolus, chamois Rupicapra rupicapra and mouflon Ovis musimon) are highly contrasted in terms of sociality (solitary to highly gregarious) and diet. The NVH at the intraspecific level was tested by relating, for the same population, diet breadth and inter-individual variation across the four seasons. Compared to null models, our data supported the NVH both at the intra- and inter-specific levels. Inter-individual variation of the diet of solitary species was not larger than in social species, although social individuals feed together and could therefore have more similar diets. Hence, the NVH better explained diet breadth than other factors such as sociality. The expansion of the population niche of the three species was driven by resource availability, and achieved by an increase in inter-individual variation, and the level of inter-individual variability was larger in the generalist species (mouflon) than in the specialist one (roe deer). This mechanism at the base of the NVH appears at play at different levels of biological organization, from populations to communities.","10","Journal","ar","Article","100","12","DNA metabarcoding | Individual heterogeneity | Large herbivores | Null models | Sociality","12925","undefined","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique","0","FALSE","1060","179","3","26198049",NA,"CNRS",NA,2015

Published by Elsevier B.V. Conservation efforts for endangered animals commonly focus on the protection of foraging habitats, aiming to ensure sufficient food availability. However, the diet of many species is based on animals that undergo habitat shifts across ontogenetic life stages, yielding considerable differences between the lifelong habitat requirements of both predator and prey. Consequently, prey availability may not only depend on the suitability of the foraging grounds where predator and prey coincide, but also on habitats where the ecological requirements of the non-prey stages are fulfilled. In this study we test to what extent prey of the insectivorous bat Rhinolophus euryale (Blasius 1853) originate either from the grounds where they are consumed, or in areas/habitats outside the bat's foraging sites. We analyzed the diet of R. euryale, by identifying its prey to the species level using DNA metabarcoding, and by searching for its prey's larval feeding requirements in the literature. We found that the larvae of the moth prey grow both inside and outside the grounds where they are hunted by the bats once the moths reach their adult stage. The importance of prey that originated from outside the bat's foraging grounds varied considerably across seasons. As a result, R. euryale does not only rely on the landscape elements where it hunts, but also on other source areas/habitats that supply it with food. This study shows that conservation measures that aim to address the foraging requirements of predatory species should not be limited to merely protecting their foraging grounds, but should also take into account the ecological requirements of their prey throughout their life stages.","13","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","DNA metabarcoding | Landscape | Ontogenetic habitat shift | Predator-prey interactions | Trophic requirements","17244","IT754-13","Eusko Jaurlaritza","1","TRUE","1061","191",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0006320715300483",2015

Understanding the ecological function of species and the structure of communities is crucial in the study of ecological interactions among species. For this purpose, not only the occurrence of particular species but also their abundance in ecological communities is required. However, abundance quantification of species through morphological characters is often difficult or time/money consuming when dealing with elusive or small taxa. Here we tested the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for abundance estimation of two species of feather mites (Proctophyllodes stylifer and Pteronyssoides parinus) under five proportions (16:1, 16:4, 16:16, 16:64, and 16:256 mites) against a mock community composed by Proctophyllodes clavatus and Proctophyllodes sylviae. In all mixtures, we retrieved sequence reads from all species. We found a strong linear relationship between 454 reads and the real proportion of individuals in the mixture for both focal species. The slope for Pr. stylifer was close to one (0.904), and the intercept close to zero (-0.007), thus showing an almost perfect correspondence between real and estimated proportions. The slope for Pt. parinus was 0.351 and the intercept 0.307, showing that while the estimated proportion increased linearly relative to real proportions of individuals in the samples, proportions were overestimated at low real proportions and underestimated at larger ones. Additionally, pyrosequencing replicates from each DNA extraction were highly repeatable (R = 0.920 and 0.972, respectively), showing that the quantification method is highly consistent given a DNA extract. Our study suggests that NGS is a promising tool for abundance estimation of feather mites’ communities in birds.","11","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","COI | High-throughput sequencing | mtDNA | NGS quantitative test | Pyrosequencing","21504","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1063","67","2","26139533",NA,NA,NA,2015

Marine sediments are home to one of the richest species pools on Earth, but logistics and a dearth of taxonomic work-force hinders the knowledge of their biodiversity. We characterized a and ß-diversity of deep-sea assemblages from submarine canyons in the western Mediterranean using an environmental DNA metabarcoding. We used a new primer set targeting a short eukaryotic 18S sequence (ca. 110 bp). We applied a protocol designed to obtain extractions enriched in extracellular DNA from replicated sediment corers. With this strategy we captured information from DNA (local or deposited from the water column) that persists adsorbed to inorganic particles and buffered short-term spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We analysed replicated samples from 20 localities including 2 deep-sea canyons, 1 shallower canal, and two open slopes (depth range 100-2,250 m). We identified 1,629 MOTUs, among which the dominant groups were Metazoa (with representatives of 19 phyla), Alveolata, Stramenopiles, and Rhizaria. There was a marked small-scale heterogeneity as shown by differences in replicates within corers and within localities. The spatial variability between canyons was significant, as was the depth component in one of the canyons where it was tested. Likewise, the composition of the first layer (1 cm) of sediment was significantly different from deeper layers. We found that qualitative (presence-absence) and quantitative (relative number of reads) data showed consistent trends of differentiation between samples and geographic areas. The subset of exclusively benthic MOTUs showed similar patterns of ß-diversity and community structure as the whole dataset. Separate analyses of the main metazoan phyla (in number of MOTUs) showed some differences in distribution attributable to different lifestyles. Our results highlight the differentiation that can be found even between geographically close assemblages, and sets the ground for future monitoring and conservation efforts on these bottoms of ecological and economic importance.","42","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1064","10","10","26436773","e0139633",NA,NA,2015

Leptospirosis essentially affects human following contact with rodent urine-contaminated water. As such, it was mainly found associated with rice culture, recreational activities and flooding. This is also the reason why it has mainly been investigated in temperate as well as warm and humid regions, while arid zones have been only very occasionally monitored for this disease. In particular, data for West African countries are extremely scarce. Here, we took advantage of an extensive survey of urban rodents in Niamey, Niger, in order to look for rodent-borne pathogenic Leptospira species presence and distribution across the city. To do so, we used high throughput bacterial 16S-based metabarcoding, lipL32 gene-targeting RT-PCR, rrs gene sequencing and VNTR typing as well as GIS-based multivariate spatial analysis. Our results show that leptospires seem absent from the core city where usual Leptospira reservoir rodent species (namely R. rattus and M. natalensis) are yet abundant. On the contrary, L. kirschneri was detected in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two rodent species that are restricted to irrigated cultures within the city. Moreover, the VNTR profiles showed that rodent-borne leptospires in Niamey belong to previously undescribed serovars. Altogether, our study points towards the importance of market gardening in maintain and circulation of leptospirosis within Sahelian cities. In Africa, irrigated urban agriculture constitutes a pivotal source of food supply, especially in the context of the ongoing extensive urbanization of the continent. With this in mind, we speculate that leptospirosis may represent a zoonotic disease of concern also in arid regions that would deserve to be more rigorously surveyed, especially in urban agricultural settings.","12","Journal","ar","Article","100","9",NA,"11900154404","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1065","9","10","26437456","e0004097",NA,NA,2015

Fungal communities in home composts were substantially different to large-scale commercial composts, with thermophilic and thermotolerant fungi present in much lower numbers.

Beetles in the widespread genus Ambrosiodmus, however, colonize decayed wood. We characterized the mycosymbionts of three Ambrosiodmus species using quantitative culturing, high-throughput metabarcoding, and histology. We determined the fungi to be within the Polyporales, closely related to Flavodon flavus. Culture-independent sequencing of Ambrosiodmus minor mycangia revealed a single operational taxonomic unit identical to the sequences from the cultured Flavodon. Histological sectioning confirmed that Ambrosiodmus possessed preoral mycangia containing dimitic hyphae similar to cultured F. cf. flavus. The Ambrosiodmus-Flavodon symbiosis is unique in several aspects: it is the first reported association between an ambrosia beetle and a basidiomycotan fungus; the mycosymbiont grows as hyphae in the mycangia, not as budding pseudo-mycelium; and the mycosymbiont is a white-rot saprophyte rather than an early colonizer: a previously undocumented wood borer niche.

The impacts of rabbits on indigenous ecosystems are well studied; notably, they cause dramatic changes in plant communities and promote soil erosion. However, the responses of fungal communities to such biotic disturbances remain unexplored. We used metabarcoding of soil extracellular DNA to assess the diversity of plant and fungal communities at sites on the sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islandswith contrasting histories of disturbance by rabbits. Our results suggest that on these islands, the simplification of plant communities and increased erosion resulting from the introduction of rabbits have driven compositional changes, including diversity reductions, in indigenous soil fungal communities. Moreover, there is no indication of recovery at sites from which rabbits were removed 20 years ago. These results imply that introduced herbivores have long-lasting and multifaceted effects on fungal biodiversity as well as highlight the low resiliency of sub-Antarctic ecosystems.","8","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Environmental DNA | Invasive species | Kerguelen islands | Metabarcoding | Soil communities","145678","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1069","11","9","26333663","20150408",NA,NA,2015

Identifying the floral composition of honey provides a method for investigating the plants that honey bees visit. We compared melissopalynology, where pollen grains retrieved from honey are identified morphologically, with a DNA metabarcoding approach using the rbcL DNA barcode marker and 454-pyrosequencing. We compared nine honeys supplied by beekeepers in the UK. DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology were able to detect the most abundant floral components of honey. There was 92% correspondence for the plant taxa that had an abundance of over 20%. However, the level of similarity when all taxa were compared was lower, ranging from 22-45%, and there was little correspondence between the relative abundance of taxa found using the two techniques. DNA metabarcoding provided much greater repeatability, with a 64% taxa match compared to 28% with melissopalynology. DNA metabarcoding has the advantage over melissopalynology in that it does not require a high level of taxonomic expertise, a greater sample size can be screened and it provides greater resolution for some plant families. However, it does not provide a quantitative approach and pollen present in low levels are less likely to be detected. We investigated the plants that were frequently used by honey bees by examining the results obtained from both techniques. Plants with a broad taxonomic range were detected, covering 46 families and 25 orders, but a relatively small number of plants were consistently seen across multiple honey samples. Frequently found herbaceous species were Rubus fruticosus, Filipendula ulmaria, Taraxacum officinale, Trifolium spp., Brassica spp. and the non-native, invasive, Impatiens glandulifera. Tree pollen was frequently seen belonging to Castanea sativa, Crataegus monogyna and species of Malus, Salix and Quercus.We conclude that although honey bees are considered to be supergeneralists in their foraging choices, there are certain key species or plant groups that are particularly important in the honey bees environment. The reasons for this require further investigation in order to better understand honey bee nutritional requirements. DNA metabarcoding can be easily and widely used to investigate floral visitation in honey bees and can be adapted for use with other insects. It provides a starting point for investigating how we can better provide for the insects that we rely upon for pollination.","61","Journal","ar","Article","100","8",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1071","10","8","26308362","e0134735",NA,NA,2015

Environmental DNA surveys are used for screening eukaryotic diversity. However, it is unclear how quantitative this approach is and to what extent results from environmental DNA studies can be used for ecological studies requiring quantitative data. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI) is used for species-level taxonomic studies of testate amoebae and should allow assessing the community composition from environmental samples, thus bypassing biases due to morphological identification. We tested this using a COI clone library approach and focusing on the Nebela collaris complex. Comparisons with direct microscopy counts showed that the COI clone library diversity data matched the morphologically identified taxa, and that community composition estimates using the two approaches were similar. However, this correlation was improved when microscopy counts were corrected for biovolume. Higher correlation with biovolume-corrected community data suggests that COI clone library data matches the ratio of mitochondria and that within closely-related taxa the density of mitochondria per unit biovolume is approximately constant. Further developments of this metabarcoding approach including quantifying the mitochondrial density among closely-related taxa, experiments on other taxonomic groups and using high throughput sequencing should make if possible to quantitatively estimate community composition of different groups, which would be invaluable for microbial food webs studies.","8","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Community ecology | Environmental DNA | Metabarcoding | Protist diversity | Sphagnum peatlands | Testate amoebae","13882","205321-109709/1",NA,"0","FALSE","1073","51","4","26196835",NA,NA,"S0932473915000577",2015

Bacterial colonization of marine plastic litter (MPL) is known for over four decades. Still, only a few studies on the plastic colonization process and its influencing factors are reported. In this study, seafloor MPL was sampled at different locations across the Belgian part of the North Sea to study bacterial community structure using 16S metabarcoding. These marine plastic bacterial communities were compared with those of sediment and seawater, and resin pellets sampled on the beach, to investigate the origin and uniqueness of plastic bacterial communities. Plastics display great variation of bacterial community composition, while each showed significant differences from those of sediment and seawater, indicating that plastics represent a distinct environmental niche. Various environmental factors correlate with the diversity of MPL bacterial composition across plastics. In addition, intrinsic plastic-related factors such as pigment content may contribute to the differences in bacterial colonization. Furthermore, the differential abundance of known primary and secondary colonizers across the various plastics may indicate different stages of bacterial colonization, and may confound comparisons of free-floating plastics. Our studies provide insights in the factors that shape plastic bacterial colonization and shed light on the possible role of plastic as transport vehicle for bacteria through the aquatic environment.","52","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"21537","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1074","49","16","26204244",NA,NA,NA,2015

Metabarcoding is an emerging genetic tool to rapidly assess biodiversity in ecosystems. It involves high-throughput sequencing of a standard gene from an environmental sample and comparison to a reference database. However, no consensus has emerged regarding laboratory pipelines to screen species diversity and infer species abundances from environmental samples. In particular, the effect of primer bias and the detection limit for specimens with a low biomass has not been systematically examined, when processing samples in bulk. We developed and tested a DNA metabarcoding protocol that utilises the standard cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcoding fragment to detect freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa. DNA was extracted in bulk, amplified in a single PCR step, and purified, and the libraries were directly sequenced in two independent MiSeq runs (300-bp paired-end reads). Specifically, we assessed the influence of specimen biomass on sequence read abundance by sequencing 31 specimens of a stonefly species with known haplotypes spanning three orders of magnitude in biomass (experiment I). Then, we tested the recovery of 52 different freshwater invertebrate taxa of similar biomass using the same standard barcoding primers (experiment II). Each experiment was replicated ten times to maximise statistical power. The results of both experiments were consistent across replicates. We found a distinct positive correlation between species biomass and resulting numbers of MiSeq reads. Furthermore, we reliably recovered 83% of the 52 taxa used to test primer bias. However, sequence abundance varied by four orders of magnitudes between taxa despite the use of similar amounts of biomass. Our metabarcoding approach yielded reliable results for high-throughput assessments. However, the results indicated that primer efficiency is highly species-specific, which would prevent straightforward assessments of species abundance and biomass in a sample. Thus, PCR-based metabarcoding assessments of biodiversity should rely on presence-absence metrics.","141","Journal","ar","Article","100","2",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1075","10","7","26154168","e0130324",NA,NA,2015

We developed a set of universal PCR primers (MiFish-U/E) for metabarcoding environmental DNA (eDNA) from fishes. Primers were designed using aligned whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences from 880 species, supplemented by partial mitogenome sequences from 160 elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). The primers target a hypervariable region of the 12S rRNA gene (163–185<U+2009>bp), which contains sufficient information to identify fishes to taxonomic family, genus and species except for some closely related congeners. To test versatility of the primers across a diverse range of fishes, we sampled eDNA from four tanks in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium with known species compositions, prepared dual-indexed libraries and performed paired-end sequencing of the region using high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies. Out of the 180 marine fish species contained in the four tanks with reference sequences in a custom database, we detected 168 species (93.3%) distributed across 59 families and 123 genera. These fishes are not only taxonomically diverse, ranging from sharks and rays to higher teleosts, but are also greatly varied in their ecology, including both pelagic and benthic species living in shallow coastal to deep waters. We also sampled natural seawaters around coral reefs near the aquarium and detected 93 fish species using this approach. Of the 93 species, 64 were not detected in the four aquarium tanks, rendering the total number of species detected to 232 (from 70 families and 152 genera). The metabarcoding approach presented here is non-invasive, more efficient, more cost-effective and more sensitive than the traditional survey methods. It has the potential to serve as an alternative (or complementary) tool for biodiversity monitoring that revolutionizes natural resource management and ecological studies of fish communities on larger spatial and temporal scales.","112","Journal","ar","Article","100","12","Community ecology | Environmental DNA | Metabarcoding | MiSeq | Mitogenome | Resource management","21100446014","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1077","2","7",NA,"150088",NA,NA,2015

The fungal diversity associated with leaves, flowers and fruits of olive (Olea europaea) was investigated in different phenological stages (May, June, October and December) using an implemented metabarcoding approach. It consisted of the 454 pyrosequencing of the fungal ITS2 region and the subsequent phylogenetic analysis of relevant genera along with validated reference sequences. Most sequences were identified up to the species level or were associated with a restricted number of related taxa enabling supported speculations regarding their biological role. Analyses revealed a rich fungal community with 195 different OTUs. Ascomycota was the dominating phyla representing 93.6% of the total number of detected sequences followed by unidentified fungi (3.6%) and Basidiomycota (2.8%). A higher level of diversity was revealed for leaves compared to flowers and fruits. Among plant pathogens the genus Colletotrichum represented by three species (C. godetiae syn. C. clavatum, C. acutatum s.s and C. karstii) was the most abundant on ripe fruits but it was also detected in other organs. Pseudocercospora cladosporioides was detected with a high frequency in all leaf samples and to a less extent in ripe fruits. A much lower relative frequency was revealed for Spilocaea oleagina and for other putative pathogens including Fusarium spp., Neofusicoccum spp., and Alternariaspp. Among non-pathogen taxa, Aureobasidium pullulans, the species complex of Cladosporium cladosporioides and Devriesia spp. were the most represented.

Studies in soil meiofauna with traditional methods are highly laborious and identification exclusively by means of morphological traits usually underestimates species richness. Although the mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I gene (COI, CO1, cox1, coxI) has been proposed as a standard DNA barcode for animals, nuclear ribosomal DNA markers such as Large Subunit (LSU, 28S) and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) have proven efficient to distinguish among species of animals, eukaryotic microbes and plants. The COI and LSU markers discriminate among closely related species of Collembola, but the efficiency of ITS2 has never been tested. We evaluated the relative performance of these three markers for DNA barcoding of Collembola. All three markers proved highly efficient in discriminating species, but LSU exhibited very low differences among certain closely related species.

All rights reserved. Niche partitioning facilitates species coexistence in a world of limited resources, thereby enriching biodiversity. For decades, biologists have sought to understand how diverse assemblages of large mammalian herbivores (LMH) partition food resources. Several complementary mechanisms have been identified, including differential consumption of grasses versus nongrasses and spatiotemporal stratification in use of different parts of the same plant. However, the extent to which LMH partition food-plant species is largely unknown because comprehensive species-level identification is prohibitively difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species (six wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers: Grass consumption inferred from mean sequence relative read abundance (RRA) ranged from >99% (plains zebra) to <1% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless, diet composition differed between all species - even pairs of grazers matched in size, digestive physiology, and location - and dietary similarity was sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.","140","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","African savannas | Body size | Coexistence | Competition | Ungulates","21121","9291-13","National Geographic Society","1","TRUE","1081","112","26","26034267",NA,NA,NA,2015

High Arctic environments are particularly sensitive to climate changes, but retrieval of paleoecological data is challenging due to low productivity and biomass. At the same time, Arctic soils and sediments have proven exceptional for long-term DNA preservation due to their constantly low temperatures. Lake sediments contain DNA paleorecords of the surrounding ecosystems and can be used to retrieve a variety of organismal groups from a single sample. In this study, we analyzed vascular plant, bryophyte, algal (in particular diatom) and copepod DNA retrieved from a sediment core spanning the Holocene, taken from Bliss Lake on the northernmost coast of Greenland. A previous multi-proxy study including microscopic diatom analyses showed that this lake experienced changes between marine and lacustrine conditions. We inferred the same environmental changes from algal DNA preserved in the sediment core. Our DNA record was stratigraphically coherent, with no indication of leaching between layers, and our cross-taxon comparisons were in accordance with previously inferred local ecosystem changes. Authentic ancient plant DNA was retrieved from nearly all layers, both from the marine and the limnic phases, and distinct temporal changes in plant presence were recovered. The plant DNA was mostly in agreement with expected vegetation history, but very early occurrences of vascular plants, including the woody Empetrum nigrum, document terrestrial vegetation very shortly after glacial retreat.

Rapid development of high-throughput (HTS) molecular identification methods has revolutionized our knowledge about taxonomic diversity and ecology of fungi.

This study was initiated to quantify potential biases in fungal community ecology by comparing the relative performance of amplicon-free shotgun metagenomics and amplicons of nine primer pairs over seven nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) regions often used in metabarcoding analyses. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) barcodes ITS1 and ITS2 provided greater taxonomic and functional resolution and richness of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97% similarity threshold compared to barcodes located within the ribosomal small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) genes. All barcode-primer pair combinations provided consistent results in ranking taxonomic richness and recovering the importance of floristic variables in driving fungal community composition in soils of Papua New Guinea. The choice of forward primer explained up to 2.0% of the variation in OTU-level analysis of the ITS1 and ITS2 barcode data sets. Across the whole data set, barcode-primer pair combination explained 37.6-38.1% of the variation, which surpassed any environmental signal. Overall, the metagenomics data set recovered a similar taxonomic overview, but resulted in much lower fungal rDNA sequencing depth, inability to infer OTUs, and high uncertainty in identification. We recommend the use of ITS2 or the whole ITS region for metabarcoding and we advocate careful choice of primer pairs in consideration of the relative proportion of fungal DNA and expected dominant groups.","115","Journal","ar","Article","100","12","High-throughput sequencing | Identification bias | Illumina MiSeq sequencing | Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) | Nuclear large subunit (LSU) | Nuclear small subunit (SSU) | Primer bias | Shotgun metagenomics | Taxonomic coverage","21100414384","9286","Eesti Teadusfondi","1","TRUE","1085","10",NA,NA,NA,"ETF",NA,2015

Human-carnivore conflict is one of the major challenges in the management of populations of large carnivores. Concerns include the increasing human population; habitat loss as a result of degradation and fragmentation of forest; and livestock predation as a result of a lack of natural prey, leading to retaliatory killings of wild carnivores. Conflicts may be further aggravated by occasional attacks that result in injury and loss of human life. The level of consumption of prey species by a predator is a benchmark to evaluate the scale of this conflict. We used a newly developed DNA-based diet analysis to study the prey profile of common leopards Panthera pardus in Ayubia National Park, Pakistan. The results suggest that the common leopard is a generalist predator, subsisting mainly on domestic animals. Based on the frequency of occurrence of prey items in 57 faecal samples, the diet of the leopard is dominated by domestic goat Capra hircus (64.9%), followed by domestic dog Canis lupus familiaris (17.5%) and cow Bos taurus (12.3%).

Assessing land-use effect on the diversity of soil biota has long been hampered by difficulties in collecting and identifying soil organisms over large areas. Recently, environmental DNA-based approaches coupled with next-generation sequencing were developed to study soil biodiversity.

This approach allowed an efficient detection of earthworm diversity and highlighted a significant land-use effect on the distribution patterns of earthworms that was not revealed by a classical survey.

The PASSIFOR project aims at developing a DNA metabarcoding approach to facilitate and enhance the monitoring of saproxylic beetles as indicators in ecological studies.

In the present contribution, we release a library including 656 records representing 410 species in 40 different families.

The continuous decline in Earth's biodiversity represents a major crisis and challenge for the 21st century, and there is international political agreement to slow down or halt this decline. The challenge is in large part impeded by the lack of knowledge on the state and distribution of biodiversity - especially since the majority of species on Earth are un-described by science. All conservation efforts to save biodiversity essentially depend on the monitoring of species and populations to obtain reliable distribution patterns and population size estimates. Such monitoring has traditionally relied on physical identification of species by visual surveys and counting of individuals. However, traditional monitoring techniques remain problematic due to difficulties associated with correct identification of cryptic species or juvenile life stages, a continuous decline in taxonomic expertise, non-standardized sampling, and the invasive nature of some survey techniques. Hence, there is urgent need for alternative and efficient techniques for large-scale biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA (eDNA) - defined here as: genetic material obtained directly from environmental samples (soil, sediment, water, etc.) without any obvious signs of biological source material - is an efficient, non-invasive and easy-to-standardize sampling approach. Coupled with sensitive, cost-efficient and ever-advancing DNA sequencing technology, it may be an appropriate candidate for the challenge of biodiversity monitoring. Environmental DNA has been obtained from ancient as well as modern samples and encompasses single species detection to analyses of ecosystems. The research on eDNA initiated in microbiology, recognizing that culture-based methods grossly misrepresent the microbial diversity in nature. Subsequently, as a method to assess the diversity of macro-organismal communities, eDNA was first analyzed in sediments, revealing DNA from extinct and extant animals and plants, but has since been obtained from various terrestrial and aquatic environmental samples. Results from eDNA approaches have provided valuable insights to the study of ancient environments and proven useful for monitoring contemporary biodiversity in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the future, we expect the eDNA-based approaches to move from single-marker analyses of species or communities to meta-genomic surveys of entire ecosystems to predict spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns. Such advances have applications for a range of biological, geological and environmental sciences. Here we review the achievements gained through analyses of eDNA from macro-organisms in a conservation context, and discuss its potential advantages and limitations for biodiversity monitoring.","343","Journal","re","Review","100","2","Biodiversity | Conservation | DNA metabarcoding | EDNA | Environmental DNA | Extinction | Monitoring","17244","undefined","Danmarks Grundforskningsfond","1","TRUE","1090","183",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0006320714004443",2015

Despite the key importance of sandy beaches as transition ecosystems between sea and land, very few studies on the microbiological composition of beach sediments have been performed. To provide a first description of microbial composition of supralittoral sediments, we investigated the composition of bacterial communities of three sandy beaches, at Favignana Island, Italy, using metagenetic approaches (Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism, sequencing of 16S rRNA genes by Illumina-Solexa technology, functional genes detection, and quantitative Real-Time PCR). Results showed that the investigated beaches are harboring a rich bacterial diversity, mainly composed by members of classes Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria and Actinobacteria. The metagenetic analysis showed profiles of decreasing beta diversity and increasing richness, as well as a differentiation of communities, along the sea-to-land axis. In particular, members of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria displayed contrasting profiles of relative abundance (to decrease and to increase, respectively) along the sea-to-land axis of the beach. Finally, a search for the presence of genes related to the nitrogen and carbon biogeochemical cycle (nifH, nosZ, pmoA/amoA) detected the presence of ammonia monoxygenase sequences (amoA) only, suggesting the presence of bacterial ammonia oxidation to some extent, probably due to members of Nitrospira, but with the lack of nitrogen fixation and denitrification.","4","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","16S rRNA gene | Bacterial communities | Metabarcoding | Sandy beaches | Supralittoral zone | T-RFLP","16799","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1091","65","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2015

However, eDNA capture and extraction protocols vary widely across studies. This use of different protocols potentially biases detection results and could significantly hinder a reliable use of eDNA to detect biodiversity. We tested whether choice of eDNA capture and extraction protocols significantly influenced biodiversity detection in aquatic systems. We sampled lake and river water, captured and extracted eDNA using six combinations of different protocols with replication, and tested for the detection of four macroinvertebrate species. Additionally, using the same lake water technical replicates, we compared the effect of capture and extraction protocols on metabarcode detections of biodiversity using 16S for eubacteria and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) for eukaryotes. Protocol combinations for capture and extraction of eDNA significantly influenced DNA yield and number of sequences obtained from next generation sequencing. We found significantly different detection rates of species ranging from zero percent to thirty-three percent. Differences in which protocol combinations produced the highest metabarcoded biodiversity were detected and demonstrate that different protocols are required for different biodiversity targets. Our results highlight that the choice of molecular protocols used for capture and extraction of eDNA from water can strongly affect biodiversity detection.

New sequencing technologies, especially when combined with standardized sampling, promise to make comprehensive biodiversity assessments and monitoring feasible on a large scale. We used this approach to characterize patterns of diversity on oyster reefs across a range of geographic scales comprising a temperate location [Virginia (VA)] and a subtropical location [Florida (FL)]. Eukaryotic organisms that colonized multilayered settlement surfaces (autonomous reef monitoring structures) over a 6-mo period were identified by cytochrome c oxidase subunit I barcoding (>2-mm mobile organisms) and metabarcoding (sessile and smaller mobile organisms). In a total area of ~15.64 m2 and volume of ~0.09 m3, 2,179 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were recorded from 983,056 sequences. However, only 10.9% could be matched to reference barcodes in public databases, with only 8.2% matching barcodes with both genus and species names. Taxonomic coverage was broad, particularly for animals (22 phyla recorded), but 35.6% of OTUs detected via metabarcoding could not be confidently assigned to a taxonomic group. The smallest size fraction (500 to 106 µm) was the most diverse (more than two-thirds of OTUs). There was little taxonomic overlap between VA and FL, and samples separated by ~2 m were significantly more similar than samples separated by ~100 m.

In the context of the sixth wave of extinction, reliable surveys of biodiversity are increasingly needed to infer the cause and consequences of species and community declines, identify early warning indicators of tipping points, and provide reliable impact assessments before engaging in activities with potential environmental hazards. DNA metabarcoding has emerged as having potential to provide speedy assessment of community structure from environmental samples. Here we tested the reliability of metabarcoding by comparing morphological and molecular inventories of invertebrate communities associated with seagrasses through estimates of alpha and beta diversity, as well as the identification of the most abundant taxa. Sediment samples were collected from six Zostera marina seagrass meadows across Brittany, France. Metabarcoding surveys were performed using both mitochondrial (Cytochrome Oxidase I) and nuclear (small subunit 18S ribosomal RNA) markers, and compared to morphological inventories compiled by a long-term benthic monitoring network. A sampling strategy was defined to enhance performance and accuracy of results by preventing the dominance of larger animals, boosting statistical support through replicates, and using two genes to compensate for taxonomic biases. Molecular barcodes proved powerful by revealing a remarkable level of diversity that vastly exceeded the morphological survey, while both surveys identified congruent differentiation of the meadows. However, despite the addition of individual barcodes of common species into taxonomic reference databases, the retrieval of only 36% of these species suggest that the remaining were either not present in the molecular samples or not detected by the molecular screening. This finding exemplifies the necessity of comprehensive and well-curated taxonomic reference libraries and multi-gene surveys. Overall, results offer methodological guidelines and support for metabarcoding as a powerful and repeatable method of characterizing communities, while also presenting suggestions for improvement, including implementation of pilot studies prior to performing full ""blind"" metabarcoding assessments to optimize sampling and amplification protocols.","73","Journal","re","Review","100","7",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1095","10","2","25668035","e0117562",NA,NA,2015

Sympatric species are expected to minimize competition by partitioning resources, especially when these are limited. Herbivores inhabiting the High Arctic in winter are a prime example of a situation where food availability is anticipated to be low, and thus reduced diet overlap is expected. We present here the first assessment of diet overlap of high arctic lemmings during winter based on DNA metabarcoding of feces. In contrast to previous analyses based on microhistology, we found that the diets of both collared (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) and brown lemmings (Lemmus trimucronatus) on Bylot Island were dominated by Salix while mosses, which were significantly consumed only by the brown lemming, were a relatively minor food item. The most abundant plant taxon, Cassiope tetragona, which alone composes more than 50% of the available plant biomass, was not detected in feces and can thus be considered to be non-food. Most plant taxa that were identified as food items were consumed in proportion to their availability and none were clearly selected for. The resulting high diet overlap, together with a lack of habitat segregation, indicates a high potential for resource competition between the two lemming species. However, Salix is abundant in the winter habitats of lemmings on Bylot Island and the non- Salix portion of the diets differed between the two species. Also, lemming grazing impact on vegetation during winter in the study area is negligible. Hence, it seems likely that the high potential for resource competition predicted between these two species did not translate into actual competition. This illustrates that even in environments with low primary productivity food resources do not necessarily generate strong competition among herbivores.","32","Journal","ar","Article","100","14",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1096","10","1","25635852","e0115335",NA,NA,2015

Metabarcoding of environmental samples on second-generation sequencing platforms has rapidly become a valuable tool for ecological studies. A fundamental assumption of this approach is the reliance on being able to track tagged amplicons back to the samples from which they originated. In this study, we address the problem of sequences in metabarcoding sequencing outputs with false combinations of used tags (tag jumps). Unless these sequences can be identified and excluded from downstream analyses, tag jumps creating sequences with false, but already used tag combinations, can cause incorrect assignment of sequences to samples and artificially inflate diversity. In this study, we document and investigate tag jumping in metabarcoding studies on Illumina sequencing platforms by amplifying mixed-template extracts obtained from bat droppings and leech gut contents with tagged generic arthropod and mammal primers, respectively. We found that an average of 2.6% and 2.1% of sequences had tag combinations, which could be explained by tag jumping in the leech and bat diet study, respectively. We suggest that tag jumping can happen during blunt-ending of pools of tagged amplicons during library build and as a consequence of chimera formation during bulk amplification of tagged amplicons during library index PCR.

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. DNA metabarcoding is a promising method for describing communities and estimating biodiversity. This approach uses high-throughput sequencing of targeted markers to identify species in a complex sample. By convention, sequences are clustered at a predefined sequence divergence threshold (often 3%) into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that serve as a proxy for species. However, variable levels of interspecific marker variation across taxonomic groups make clustering sequences from a phylogenetically diverse dataset into OTUs at a uniform threshold problematic. In this study, we use mock zooplankton communities to evaluate the accuracy of species richness estimates when following conventional protocols to cluster hypervariable sequences of the V4 region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18S) into OTUs. By including individually tagged single specimens and ""populations"" of various species in our communities, we examine the impact of intra- and interspecific diversity on OTU clustering. Communities consisting of single individuals per species generated a correspondence of 59-84% between OTU number and species richness at a 3% divergence threshold. However, when multiple individuals per species were included, the correspondence between OTU number and species richness dropped to 31-63%. Our results suggest that intraspecific variation in this marker can often exceed 3%, such that a single species does not always correspond to one OTU. We advocate the need to apply group-specific divergence thresholds when analyzing complex and taxonomically diverse communities, but also encourage the development of additional filtering steps that allow identification of artifactual rRNA gene sequences or pseudogenes that may generate spurious OTUs. Using four mock zooplankton communities, we validate the metabarcoding method by evaluating the accuracy of species richness estimates generated when clustering hypervariable sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). By individually tagging single individuals and ""populations"" of various species in our communities, we examine the impact of intra- and interspecific diversity on OTU clustering. Our results suggest that intraspecific variation in the V4 region of 18S can often exceed 3% in metazoans, and advocate the use of group-specific divergence thresholds when OTU clustering.","39","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","nSSU | Biodiversity | High-throughput sequencing | Metabarcoding | Mock community | Zooplankton","21100264002","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1099","5","11",NA,NA,NA,NA,2015

Additionally, samples were analyzed by light microscopy. We found significant rank-based associations between the relative abundance of pollen types within our samples as inferred by the two methods. Conclusions: Our findings suggest metabarcoding data from plastid loci, as opposed to the ribosomal locus, are more reliable for quantitative characterization of pollen assemblages.

Understanding the role of predators in food webs can be challenging in highly diverse predator/prey systems composed of small cryptic species. DNA based dietary analysis can supplement predator removal experiments and provide high resolution for prey identification. Here we use a metabarcoding approach to provide initial insights into the diet and functional role of coral-dwelling predatory fish feeding on small invertebrates. Fish were collected inMoorea (French Polynesia) where the BIOCODE project has generated DNA barcodes for numerous coral associated invertebrate species. Pyrosequencing data revealed a total of 292 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) in the gut contents of the arc-eye hawkfish (Paracirrhites arcatus), the flame hawkfish (Neocirrhites armatus) and the coral croucher (Caracanthus maculatus). One hundred forty-nine (51%) of them had species-level matches in reference libraries (>98% similarity) while 76 additional OTUs (26%) could be identified to higher taxonomic levels. Decapods that have a mutualistic relationship with Pocillopora and are typically dominant among coral branches, represent a minor contribution of the predators' diets. Instead, predators mainly consumed transient species including pelagic taxa such as copepods, chaetognaths and siphonophores suggesting non random feeding behavior. We also identified prey species known to have direct negative interactions with stony corals, such as Hapalocarcinus sp, a gall crab considered a coral parasite, as well as species of vermetid snails known for their deleterious effects on coral growth. Pocillopora DNA accounted for 20.8% and 20.1% of total number of sequences in the guts of the flame hawkfish and coral croucher but it was not detected in the guts of the arc-eye hawkfish. Comparison of diets among the three fishes demonstrates remarkable partitioning with nearly 80% of prey items consumed by only one predator. Overall, the taxonomic resolution provided by the metabarcoding approach highlights a highly complex interaction web and demonstrates that levels of trophic partitioning among coral reef fishes have likely been underestimated. Therefore, we strongly encourage further empirical approaches to dietary studies prior to making assumptions of trophic equivalency in food web reconstruction.","30","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","COI | Coral reefs | Exosymbionts | Food web | Interactions | Invertebrates | Mutualism | Pyrosequencing","21100239256","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1102","2015","6",NA,"1047",NA,NA,2015

Protists, the most diverse eukaryotes, are largely considered to be free-living bacterivores, but vast numbers of taxa are known to parasitize plants or animals. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches now commonly replace cultivation-based approaches in studying soil protists, but insights into common biases associated with this method are limited to aquatic taxa and samples. We created a mock community of common free-living soil protists (amoebae, flagellates, ciliates), extracted DNA and amplified it in the presence of metazoan DNA using 454 HTS. We aimed at evaluating whether HTS quantitatively reveals true relative abundances of soil protists and at investigating whether the expected protist community structure is altered by the co-amplification of metazoan-associated protist taxa. Indeed, HTS revealed fundamentally different protist communities from those expected. Ciliate sequences were highly over-represented, while those of most amoebae and flagellates were under-represented or totally absent. These results underpin the biases introduced by HTS that prevent reliable quantitative estimations of free-living protist communities. Furthermore, we detected a wide range of nonadded protist taxa probably introduced along with metazoan DNA, which altered the protist community structure. Among those, 20 taxa most closely resembled parasitic, often pathogenic taxa. Therewith, we provide the first HTS data in support of classical observational studies that showed that potential protist parasites are hosted by soil metazoa. Taken together, profound differences in amplification success between protist taxa and an inevitable co-extraction of protist taxa parasitizing soil metazoa obscure the true diversity of free-living soil protist communities.

Information provided by melissopalynology could guide floral enrichment efforts aimed at supporting pollinators, but it has rarely been used because traditional methods of pollen identification are laborious and require expert knowledge. We approach melissopalynology in a novel way, employing a molecular method to study the pollen foraging of honey bees ( Apis mellifera ) in a landscape dominated by field crops, and compare these results to those obtained by microscopic melissopalynology. Methods: Pollen was collected from honey bee colonies in Madison County, Ohio, USA, during a two-week period in midspring and identified using microscopic methods and ITS2 metabarcoding. Results: Metabarcoding identified 19 plant families and exhibited sensitivity for identifying the taxa present in large and diverse pollen samples relative to microscopy, which identified eight families. The bulk of pollen collected by honey bees was from trees (Sapindaceae, Oleaceae, and Rosaceae), although dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale ) and mustard (Brassicaceae) pollen were also abundant. Discussion: For quantitative analysis of pollen, using both metabarcoding and microscopic identification is superior to either individual method. For qualitative analysis, ITS2 metabarcoding is superior, providing heightened sensitivity and genus-level resolution.","64","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Apis mellifera | bee foraging landscape | Fraxinus | palynology | pollen analysis | pollinator ecology","21100403506","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1104","3","1",NA,"1400066",NA,NA,2015

Ctenomys minutus and C. flamarioni are subterranean rodents parapatrically distributed in the southern Brazilian coastal plain, showing a narrow sympatric zone. To gain understanding on food preferences and possible competition for food resources, we evaluated their diet composition performing DNA metabarcoding analyzes of 67 C. minutus and 100 C. flamarioni scat samples, collected along the species geographical ranges. Thirteen plant families, mainly represented by Poaceae, Araliaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae, were identified in the diet of C. minutus. For C. flamarioni, 10 families were recovered, with a predominance of Poaceae, Araliaceae and Asteraceae. A significant correlation between diet composition and geographical distance was detected in C. minutus, whereas the diet of C. flamarioni was quite homogeneous throughout its geographical distribution. No significant differences were observed between males and females of each species. However, differences in diet composition between species were evident according to multivariate analysis. Our results suggest some level of diet partitioning between C. flamarioni and C. minutus in the sympatric region. While the first species is more specialized on few plant items, the second showed a more varied and heterogeneous diet pattern among individuals. These differences might have been developed to avoid competition in the region of co-occurrence. Resource availability in the environment also seems to influence food choices. Our data indicate that C. minutus and C. flamarioni are generalist species, but that some preference for Poaceae, Asteraceae and Araliaceae families can be suggested for both rodents.","27","Journal","ar","Article","100","14",NA,"22235","undefined","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico","1","TRUE","1105","114","5","25649502",NA,"CNPq",NA,2015

Diatoms are frequently used for water quality assessments; however, identification to species level is difficult, time-consuming and needs in-depth knowledge of the organisms under investigation, as nonhomoplastic species-specific morphological characters are scarce. We here investigate how identification methods based on DNA (metabarcoding using NGS platforms) perform in comparison to morphological diatom identification and propose a workflow to optimize diatom fresh water quality assessments. Diatom diversity at seven different sites along the course of the river system Odra and Lusatian Neisse from the source to the mouth is analysed with DNA and morphological methods, which are compared. The NGS technology almost always leads to a higher number of identified taxa (270 via NGS vs. 103 by light microscopy LM), whose presence could subsequently be verified by LM. The sequence-based approach allows for a much more graduated insight into the taxonomic diversity of the environmental samples. Taxa retrieval varies considerably throughout the river system, depending on species occurrences and the taxonomic depth of the reference databases. Mostly rare taxa from oligotrophic parts of the river systems are less well represented in the reference database used. A workflow for DNA-based NGS diatom identification is presented. 28 000 diatom sequences were evaluated. Our findings provide evidence that metabarcoding of diatoms via NGS sequencing of the V4 region (18S) has a great potential for water quality assessments and could complement and maybe even improve the identification via light microscopy.","67","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Diatoms | DNA-based specimen identification | Environmental DNA barcoding | Next-generation sequencing | Water monitoring","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1106","15","3","25270047",NA,NA,NA,2015

Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is increasingly used to study the present and past biodiversity. eDNA analyses often rely on amplification of very small quantities or degraded DNA. To avoid missing detection of taxa that are actually present (false negatives), multiple extractions and amplifications of the same samples are often performed. However, the level of replication needed for reliable estimates of the presence/absence patterns remains an unaddressed topic. Furthermore, degraded DNA and PCR/sequencing errors might produce false positives. We used simulations and empirical data to evaluate the level of replication required for accurate detection of targeted taxa in different contexts and to assess the performance of methods used to reduce the risk of false detections. Furthermore, we evaluated whether statistical approaches developed to estimate occupancy in the presence of observational errors can successfully estimate true prevalence, detection probability and false-positive rates. Replications reduced the rate of false negatives; the optimal level of replication was strongly dependent on the detection probability of taxa. Occupancy models successfully estimated true prevalence, detection probability and false-positive rates, but their performance increased with the number of replicates. At least eight PCR replicates should be performed if detection probability is not high, such as in ancient DNA studies. Multiple DNA extractions from the same sample yielded consistent results; in some cases, collecting multiple samples from the same locality allowed detecting more species. The optimal level of replication for accurate species detection strongly varies among studies and could be explicitly estimated to improve the reliability of results.","160","Journal","ar","Article","100","12","Detectability | Earthworms | False negatives | False-positive detection | Lake sediments | Occupancy modelling | Simulations | Species occurrence","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1107","15","3","25327646",NA,NA,NA,2015

Here, we used two faecal samples to characterize the diet of two red-shanked doucs langurs (Pygathrix nemaeus) that were fed known foliage, fruits, vegetables and cereals. Illumina HiSeq produced ~74 and 67 million paired reads for these samples, of which ~10 000 (0.014%) and ~44 000 (0.066%), respectively, were of chloroplast origin.

Metagenomics identified seven and nine of the likely 16 diet plants while six and five were identified by metabarcoding. Metabarcoding produced thousands of reads consistent with the known diet, but the barcodes were too short to identify several plant species to genus. Metagenomics utilized multiple, longer barcodes that combined had greater power of identification. However, rare diet items were not recovered. Read numbers for diet species in metagenomic and metabarcoding data were correlated, indicating that both are useful for determining relative sequence abundance. Metagenomic reads were uniformly distributed across the chloroplast genomes; thus, if chloroplast genomes were used as reference, the precision of identifications and species recovery would improve further.

Reconstructing past vegetation and species diversity from arctic lake sediments can be challenging because of low pollen and plant macrofossil concentrations. Information may be enhanced by metabarcoding of sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA). We developed a Holocene record from Lake Skartjørna, Svalbard, using sedaDNA, plant macrofossils and sediment properties, and compared it with published records. All but two genera of vascular plants identified as macrofossils in this or a previous study were identified with sedaDNA. Six additional vascular taxa were found, plus two algal and 12 bryophyte taxa, by sedaDNA analysis, which also detected more species per sample than macrofossil analysis. A shift from Salix polaris-dominated vegetation, with Koenigia islandica, Ranunculaceae and the relatively thermophilic species Arabis alpina and Betula, to Dryas octopetala-dominated vegetation ~6600–5500 cal. BP suggests a transition from moist conditions 1–2°C warmer than today to colder/drier conditions. This coincides with a decrease in runoff, inferred from core lithology, and an independent record of declining lacustrine productivity. This mid-Holocene change in terrestrial vegetation is broadly coincident with changes in records from marine sediments off the west coast of Svalbard. Over the Holocene sedaDNA records little floristic change, and it clearly shows species persisted near the lake during time intervals when they are not detected as macrofossils. The flora has shown resilience in the presence of a changing climate, and, if future warming is limited to 2°C or less, we might expect only minor floristic changes in this region. However, the Holocene record provides no analogues for greater warming.","21","Journal","ar","Article","100","11","ancient DNA | Arctic | climate change | metabarcoding | plant macrofossils | vegetation reconstruction","22634","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1110","26","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,2015

Photosynthetic eukaryotes have a critical role as the main producers in most ecosystems of the biosphere. The ongoing environmental metabarcoding revolution opens the perspective for holistic ecosystems biological studies of these organisms, in particular the unicellular microalgae that often lack distinctive morphological characters and have complex life cycles. To interpret environmental sequences, metabarcoding necessarily relies on taxonomically curated databases containing reference sequences of the targeted gene (or barcode) from identified organisms. To date, no such reference framework exists for photosynthetic eukaryotes. In this study, we built the PhytoREF database that contains 6490 plastidial 16S rDNA reference sequences that originate from a large diversity of eukaryotes representing all known major photosynthetic lineages. We compiled 3333 amplicon sequences available from public databases and 879 sequences extracted from plastidial genomes, and generated 411 novel sequences from cultured marine microalgal strains belonging to different eukaryotic lineages. A total of 1867 environmental Sanger 16S rDNA sequences were also included in the database. Stringent quality filtering and a phylogeny-based taxonomic classification were applied for each 16S rDNA sequence. The database mainly focuses on marine microalgae, but sequences from land plants (representing half of the PhytoREF sequences) and freshwater taxa were also included to broaden the applicability of PhytoREF to different aquatic and terrestrial habitats.

Bee populations and other pollinators face multiple, synergistically acting threats, which have led to population declines, loss of local species richness and pollination services, and extinctions. However, our understanding of the degree, distribution and causes of declines is patchy, in part due to inadequate monitoring systems, with the challenge of taxonomic identification posing a major logistical barrier. Pollinator conservation would benefit from a high-throughput identification pipeline. We show that the metagenomic mining and resequencing of mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomics) can be applied successfully to bulk samples of wild bees. We assembled the mitogenomes of 48 UK bee species and then shotgun-sequenced total DNA extracted from 204 whole bees that had been collected in 10 pan-trap samples from farms in England and been identified morphologically to 33 species. Each sample data set was mapped against the 48 reference mitogenomes. The morphological and mitogenomic data sets were highly congruent. Out of 63 total species detections in the morphological data set, the mitogenomic data set made 59 correct detections (93·7% detection rate) and detected six more species (putative false positives). Direct inspection and an analysis with species-specific primers suggested that these putative false positives were most likely due to incorrect morphological IDs. Read frequency significantly predicted species biomass frequency (R<sup>2</sup> = 24·9%). Species lists, biomass frequencies, extrapolated species richness and community structure were recovered with less error than in a metabarcoding pipeline. Mitogenomics automates the onerous task of taxonomic identification, even for cryptic species, allowing the tracking of changes in species richness and distributions. A mitogenomic pipeline should thus be able to contain costs, maintain consistently high-quality data over long time series, incorporate retrospective taxonomic revisions and provide an auditable evidence trail. Mitogenomic data sets also provide estimates of species counts within samples and thus have potential for tracking population trajectories.","62","Journal","ar","Article","100","15","Agri-environment schemes | Biodiversity and ecosystem services | Farmland biodiversity | Genome skimming | Hymenoptera | Metabarcoding | Metagenomics | Mitogenomes | Neonicotinoids | Pollination","21100217611","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1112","6","9",NA,NA,NA,NA,2015

Accurate molecular identification of species depends on the ability to generate operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that correspond to biological species. Due to the sometimes enormous estimates of biodiversity using this method, there is a great need to test the efficacy of data analysis methods used to derive OTUs. Here, we evaluate the performance of various methods for clustering length variable 18S amplicons from complex samples into OTUs using a mock community and a natural community of zooplankton species. We compare analytic procedures consisting of a combination of (1) stringent and relaxed data filtering, (2) singleton sequences included and removed, (3) three commonly used clustering algorithms (mothur, UCLUST, and UPARSE), and (4) three methods of treating alignment gaps when calculating sequence divergence. Depending on the combination of methods used, the number of OTUs varied by nearly two orders of magnitude for the mock community (60-5068 OTUs) and three orders of magnitude for the natural community (22-22191 OTUs). The use of relaxed filtering and the inclusion of singletons greatly inflated OTU numbers without increasing the ability to recover species. Our results also suggest that the method used to treat gaps when calculating sequence divergence can have a great impact on the number of OTUs. Our findings are particularly relevant to studies that cover taxonomically diverse species and employ markers such as rRNA genes in which length variation is extensive.","61","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","18S rRNA | Biodiversity | eDNA | High-throughput sequencing | Metabarcoding | OTU","21100264002","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1113","5","11",NA,NA,NA,NA,2015

Biological invasions are a major threat to the world’s biodiversity with consequences on ecosystem structure and functioning, species evolution, and human well-being (through ecosystem services). Conservation of biological diversity and management of biological resources require multi-level management strategies on non-native species, in order to (1) prevent biological introductions, (2) detect non-native species at an early stage of the introduction, and (3) eradicate or maintain at a low level of population density non-native species that were successfully introduced. A pre-requisite to any control measures on non-native species is the ability to rapidly and accurately identify the putative threatening alien species. DNA barcoding, and its recent extension, DNA metabarcoding are complementary tools that have proved their value in the identification of living beings. Here we review their use in the identification of non-native species at several steps of the introduction processes, and how they can be applied in the control and management of biological introductions.

Micro-organisms associated with plants and animals affect host fitness, shape community structure and influence ecosystem properties. Climate change is expected to influence microbial communities, but their reactions are not well understood. Host-associated micro-organisms are influenced by the climate reactions of their hosts, which may undergo range shifts due to climatic niche tracking, or may be actively relocated to mitigate the effects of climate change. We used a common-garden experiment and rDNA metabarcoding to examine the effect of host relocation and high-latitude warming on the complex fungal endophytic microbiome associated with leaves of an ecologically dominant boreal forest tree (Populus balsamifera L.). We also considered the potential effects of poplar genetic identity in defining the reactions of the microbiome to the treatments. The relocation of hosts to the north increased the diversity of the microbiome and influenced its structure, with results indicating enemy release from plausible pathogens. High-latitude warming decreased microbiome diversity in comparison with natural northern conditions. The warming also caused structural changes, which made the fungal communities distinct in comparison with both low-latitude and high-latitude natural communities, and increased the abundance of plausible pathogens. The reactions of the microbiome to relocation and warming were strongly dependent on host genetic identity. This suggests that climate change effects on host-microbiome systems may be mediated by the interaction of environmental factors and the population genetic processes of the hosts.","48","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Climate change | Community genetics | Enemy release | Metabarcoding | micro-organism biogeography | plant-fungal interactions","20297","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1115","24","1","25443313",NA,NA,NA,2015

Soils encompass a huge diversity of organisms which mostly remains to be characterized due to a number of methodological and logistical issues. Nonetheless, remarkable progress has been made in recent years toward developing strategies to characterize and describe soil biodiversity, especially thanks to the development of molecular approaches relying on direct DNA extraction from the soil matrix.Metabarcoding can be applied to DNA from any environment or organism, and is gaining increasing prominence in biodiversity studies. This approach is already commonly used to characterize soil microbial communities and its application is now being extended to other soil organisms, i.e. meso- and macro-fauna.These developments offer unprecedented scientific and operational opportunities in order to better understand soil biodiversity distribution and dynamics, and to propose tools and strategies for biodiversity diagnosis. However, these opportunities also come with challenges that the scientific community must face. Such challenges are related to i) clarification of terminology, (ii) standardisation of methods and further methodological development for additional taxonomic groups, (iii) development of a common database, and (iv) ways to avoid waste of information and data derived from metabarcoding. In order to facilitate common application of metabarcoding in soil biodiversity assessment, we discuss these opportunities and challenges and propose solutions towards a more homogeneous framework.","44","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","DNA | Metabarcoding | Soil biodiversity | Standard Operating Procedures","14802","FP7-264465","European Commission","1","TRUE","1116","80",NA,NA,NA,NA,"S0038071714003617",2015

Most streams receive substantial inputs of allochthonous organic material in the form of leaves and twigs (CPOM , coarse particulate organic matter). Mechanical and biological processing converts this into fine particulate organic matter (FPOM). Other sources of particles include flocculated dissolved matter and soil particles. Fungi are known to play a role in the CPOM conversion process, but the taxonomic affiliations of these fungi remain poorly studied. The present study seeks to shed light on the composition of fungal communities on FPOM and CPOM as assessed in a natural stream in Nova Scotia, Canada. Maple leaves were exposed in a stream for four weeks and their fungal community evaluated through pyrosequencing. Over the same period, four FPOM size fractions were collected by filtration and assessed. Particles had much lower ergosterol contents than leaves, suggesting major differences in the extent of fungal colonization. Pyrosequencing documented a total of 821 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTU), of which 726 were exclusive to particles and 47 to leaf samples. Characterizing fungal communities may shed some light on the origins and processing pathways of fine particles in streams and broadens our view of the phylogenetic composition of fungi in freshwater ecosystems.","5","Journal","ar","Article","100","3",NA,"21100258853","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1117","4",NA,NA,"1378",NA,NA,2015

The quantification of the biological diversity in environmental samples using high-throughput DNA sequencing is hindered by the PCR bias caused by variable primer-template mismatches of the individual species. In some dietary studies, there is the added problem that samples are enriched with predator DNA, so often a predator-specific blocking oligonucleotide is used to alleviate the problem. However, specific blocking oligonucleotides could coblock nontarget species to some degree. Here, we accurately estimate the extent of the PCR biases induced by universal and blocking primers on a mock community prepared with DNA of twelve species of terrestrial arthropods. We also compare universal and blocking primer biases with those induced by variable annealing temperature and number of PCR cycles. The results show that reads of all species were recovered after PCR enrichment at our control conditions (no blocking oligonucleotide, 45 °C annealing temperature and 40 cycles) and high-throughput sequencing. They also show that the four factors considered biased the final proportions of the species to some degree. Among these factors, the number of primer-template mismatches of each species had a disproportionate effect (up to five orders of magnitude) on the amplification efficiency. In particular, the number of primer-template mismatches explained most of the variation (~3/4) in the amplification efficiency of the species. The effect of blocking oligonucleotide concentration on nontarget species relative abundance was also significant, but less important (below one order of magnitude). Considering the results reported here, the quantitative potential of the technique is limited, and only qualitative results (the species list) are reliable, at least when targeting the barcoding COI region.","89","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Annealing temperature | Insects | Ion Torrent | PCR bias | PCR cycles","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1118","15","4","25454249",NA,NA,NA,2015

Assessing how natural environmental drivers affect biodiversity underpins our understanding of the relationships between complex biotic and ecological factors in natural ecosystems. Of all ecosystems, anthropogenically important estuaries represent a 'melting pot' of environmental stressors, typified by extreme salinity variations and associated biological complexity. Although existing models attempt to predict macroorganismal diversity over estuarine salinity gradients, attempts to model microbial biodiversity are limited for eukaryotes. Although diatoms commonly feature as bioindicator species, additional microbial eukaryotes represent a huge resource for assessing ecosystem health. Of these, meiofaunal communities may represent the optimal compromise between functional diversity that can be assessed using morphology and phenotype-environment interactions as compared with smaller life fractions. Here, using 454 Roche sequencing of the 18S nSSU barcode we investigate which of the local natural drivers are most strongly associated with microbial metazoan and sampled protist diversity across the full salinity gradient of the estuarine ecosystem. In order to investigate potential variation at the ecosystem scale, we compare two geographically proximate estuaries (Thames and Mersey, UK) with contrasting histories of anthropogenic stress. The data show that although community turnover is likely to be predictable, taxa are likely to respond to different environmental drivers and, in particular, hydrodynamics, salinity range and granulometry, according to varied life-history characteristics. At the ecosystem level, communities exhibited patterns of estuary-specific similarity within different salinity range habitats, highlighting the environmental sequencing biomonitoring potential of meiofauna, dispersal effects or both.","53","Journal","ar","Article","100","13",NA,"5800173382","NE/E001505/1",NA,"1","TRUE","1119","9","5","25423027",NA,NA,"ismej2014213",2015

Here we evaluate a suite of environmental DNA (eDNA) markers coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS) that span the tree of life, comparing them with traditional biodiversity monitoring tools within ten 20 × 20 meter plots along a 700 meter elevational gradient. Results: From six eDNA datasets (one from each of 16S, 18S, ITS, trnL and two from COI) we identified sequences from 109 NCBI taxonomy-defined phyla or equivalent, ranging from 31 to 60 for a given eDNA marker. Estimates of alpha and gamma diversity were sensitive to the number of sequence reads, whereas beta diversity estimates were less sensitive. The average within-plot beta diversity was lower than between plots for all markers. The soil beta diversity of COI and 18S markers showed the strongest response to the elevational variation of the eDNA markers (COI: r = 0.49, p < 0.001; 18S: r = 0.48, p < 0.001). Furthermore pairwise beta diversities for these two markers were strongly correlated with those calculated from traditional vegetation and invertebrate biodiversity measures. Conclusions: Using a soil-based eDNA approach, we demonstrate that standard phylogenetic markers are capable of recovering sequences from a broad diversity of eukaryotes, in addition to prokaryotes by 16S. The COI and 18S eDNA markers are the best proxies for aboveground biodiversity based on the high correlation between the pairwise beta diversities of these markers and those obtained using traditional methods.","44","Journal","ar","Article","100","17","Biodiversity assessment | Environmental DNA | Genomic observatory | Metabarcoding","21100420802","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1120","4","1","26445670","46",NA,NA,2015

We carried out deep DNA sequencing of soil samples to study the long-term effects of experimental warming on fungal communities in dry heath and moist tussock tundra in Arctic Alaska. The data presented here indicate that fungal community composition responds strongly to warming in the moist tundra, but not in the dry tundra. While total fungal richness was not significantly affected by warming, there were clear correlations among operational taxonomic unit richness of various ecological and taxonomic groups and long-term warming. Richness of ectomycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal and lichenized fungi generally decreased with warming, while richness of saprotrophic, plant and animal pathogenic, and root endophytic fungi tended to increase in the warmed plots. More importantly, various taxa within these functional guilds followed opposing trends that highlight the importance of species-specific responses to warming.

Aquaculture is an extremely valuable and rapidly expanding sector of the seafood industry. The sediment below active aquaculture farms receives inputs of organic matter from uneaten food and faecal material and this has led to concerns related to environmental sustainability. The impacts of organic enrichment on macrobenthic infauna are well characterized; however, much less is known about effect on bacterial communities. In this study, sediment, macrobenthic infauna samples and environmental data were collected along an enrichment gradient radiating out from a Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) farm (Marlborough Sounds; New Zealand). DNA and RNA were extracted and 16S rRNA metabarcodes from bacterial communities characterized using high-throughput sequencing. Desulfobacterales dominated at the cage (DNA and RNA), and at sites 50 m (DNA and RNA) and 150 m (RNA) from the farm. In contrast, unclassified bacteria from the class Gammaproteobacteria were the most abundant taxa at control sites (625 and 4000 m). Pronounced differences among DNA and RNA samples occurred at the cage site where Desulfobacterales abundance was markedly higher in RNA samples. There were strong correlations between shifts in bacterial communities and total organic matter and redox. This suggests that bacterial composition is strongly influenced by organic enrichment, a trait that may make them useful for assessing impacts associated with aquaculture farms.","22","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Aquaculture | Bacterial diveristy | High-throughput sequencing | Salmon farming","19705","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1123","91","8","26207046","fiv089",NA,NA,2015

The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is one of the most significant pathogen vectors of the twenty-first century. Originating from Asia, it has invaded a wide range of eco-climatic regions worldwide. The insect-associated microbiota is now recognized to play a significant role in host biology. While genetic diversity bottlenecks are known to result from biological invasions, the resulting shifts in host-associated microbiota diversity has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this subject, we compared four autochthonous Ae. albopictus populations in Vietnam, the native area of Ae. albopictus, and three populations recently introduced to Metropolitan France, with the aim of documenting whether these populations display differences in host genotype and bacterial microbiota. Population-level genetic diversity (microsatellite markers and COI haplotype) and bacterial diversity (16S rDNA metabarcoding) were compared between field-caught mosquitoes. Bacterial microbiota from the whole insect bodies were largely dominated by Wolbachia pipientis. Targeted analysis of the gut microbiota revealed a greater bacterial diversity in which a fraction was common between French and Vietnamese populations. The genus Dysgonomonas was the most prevalent and abundant across all studied populations. Overall genetic diversities of both hosts and bacterial microbiota were significantly reduced in recently established populations of France compared to the autochthonous populations of Vietnam. These results open up many important avenues of investigation in order to link the process of geographical invasion to shifts in commensal and symbiotic microbiome communities, as such shifts may have dramatic impacts on the biology and/or vector competence of invading hematophagous insects.","28","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","Aedes albopictus | Dysgonomonas | Holobiont | Microbiota | Microsatellite | Phylogeography | Wolbachia","21100226442","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1124","6","SEP",NA,"00970",NA,NA,2015

Other key movements include the use of barcoding and metabarcoding approaches for dietary analyses-and for studies of food webs spanning three or more trophic levels-as well as the spread of next-generation sequencing methods in multiple contexts. In combination with the rising taxonomic and geographic scope of many barcoding iniatives, these developments suggest that several important questions in biology are becoming tractable. ""What is this specimen on an agricultural shipment?"", ""Who eats whom in this whole food web?"", and even ""How many species are there?"" are questions that may be answered in time periods ranging from a few years to one or a few decades.

Considerable efforts have been made to integrate phylogenetics and community ecology into a single theoretical framework. Yet, assessing phylogenetic structure at the community scale remains a great challenge, in particular for poorly known organisms. While DNA meta-barcoding is increasingly used for assessing taxonomic composition of complex communities from environmental samples, biases and limitations of this technique can preclude the retrieval of information on phylogenetic community structure. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Andújar et al.

Using molecular tools to examine community composition of meiofauna, animals 45. µm to 1. mm in size living between sediment grains in aquatic environments, is relatively new in comparison to bacterial and archaeal microbial studies. Although high-throughput molecular approaches are starting to be applied to these ccommunities, effectiveness of different approaches for nucleic acid extraction from meiofauna is poorly known and bioinformatic pipelines vary between studies. Given this situation, there is a need for protocols to be developed that promote consistency in sample collection and processing, sequence quality filtering, and Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) clustering methods. Herein, we assess different approaches used for DNA extraction (DNA extracted directly from sediment versus elutriated material retained on a 45. µm sieve) as well as how different quality filtering methods of sequences and OTU clustering algorithms impact genetic assessment of meiofauna community composition. DNA extracted directly from sediment resulted in higher presence of non-metazoan eukaryotic taxa; in contrast, an elutriation (resuspension with decanting) approach increased meiofauna abundance and enriched metazoan OTUs. In regards to bioinformatics analyses, the number of overall OTUs varied by clustering algorithm, primarily due to the applied method of sequence quality filtering. However, alpha and beta diversity analyses showed similar trends regardless of bioinformatics pipeline utilized. Based on our results, we recommend studies of meiofauna communities first elutriate samples prior to DNA extraction and include multiple biological replicates to account for variation in community-level composition. The quality filtering method should be carefully considered as this step accounted for large discrepancy in the number of OTUs inferred.","20","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","Clustering | Eukaryote | Illumina | Meiofauna | Metabarcoding | V9","11700154718","DEB-1036537","National Science Foundation","0","FALSE","1127","23",NA,"26001512",NA,NA,"S1874778715000847",2015

Understanding community assembly and population dynamics frequently requires detailed knowledge of food web structure. For many consumers, obtaining precise information about diet composition has traditionally required sacrificing animals or other highly invasive procedures, generating tension between maintaining intact study populations and knowing what they eat. We developed 16S mitochondrial DNA sequencing methods to identify arthropods in the diets of generalist vertebrate predators without requiring a blocking primer. We demonstrate the utility of these methods for a common Caribbean lizard that has been intensively studied in the context of small island food webs: Anolis sagrei (a semi-arboreal 'trunk-ground' anole ecomorph). Novel PCR primers were identified in silico and tested in vitro. Illumina sequencing successfully characterized the arthropod component of 168 faecal DNA samples collected during three field trips spanning 12 months, revealing 217 molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) from at least nine arthropod orders (including Araneae, Blattodea, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera). Three mOTUs (one beetle, one cockroach and one ant) were particularly frequent, occurring in =50% of samples, but the majority of mOTUs were infrequent (180, or 83%, occurred in =5% of samples). Species accumulation curves showed that dietary richness and composition were similar between size-dimorphic sexes; however, female lizards had greater per-sample dietary richness than males. Overall diet composition (but not richness) was significantly different across seasons, and we found more pronounced interindividual variation in December than in May. These methods will be generally useful in characterizing the diets of diverse insectivorous vertebrates.","20","Journal","ar","Article","100","2","Anolis sagrei | Diet analysis | DNA barcodes | Metabarcoding | Mitochondrial 16S DNA | Predator-prey interactions","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1130","15","4","25545675",NA,NA,NA,2015

Soaring throughput, plummeting costs, and increased sensitivity for assaying degraded or low-concentration DNA are driving a revolution in the way that we monitor biodiversity. Arguably the biggest 'game-changer' is environmental DNA (eDNA), which refers to free-floating DNA released by organisms into their environment. Rare or elusive species can be detected with greater sensitivity and accuracy using eDNA than by most conventional methods, and we have the capability to screen and describe whole communities, as well as perform targeted monitoring of single species. This paper discusses the basic approaches for molecular monitoring of biodiversity, provides case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques, and considers any challenges and limitations that could impact molecular biological recording. It is argued that eDNA surveys offer exciting new opportunities to engage the public in biological recording and that molecular approaches will complement conventional surveys, enabling unprecedented insights into species distributions. Finally, with the number of eDNA studies increasing at a rapid pace, it is argued that there is a need to rapidly establish ways of managing molecular records. Integrating molecular records into existing biological records databases would enhance our understanding of species distributions and may be something that the Biological Records Centre should be considering to mark its landmark anniversary.","50","Journal","ar","Article","100","1","Biodiversity monitoring | Citizen science | DNA barcoding | eDNA | Environmental DNA | Invasive species | Metabarcoding | Molecular food webs | Trophic interactions","29771","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1131","115","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,2015

Paleoenvironmental studies are essential to understand biodiversity changes over long timescales and to assess the relative importance of anthropogenic and environmental factors. Sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) is an emerging tool in the field of paleoecology and has proven to be a complementary approach to the use of pollen and macroremains for investigating past community changes. SedaDNA-based reconstructions of ancient environments often rely on indicator taxa or expert knowledge, but quantitative ecological analyses might provide more objective information. Here, we analysed sedaDNA to investigate plant community trajectories in the catchment of a high-elevation lake in the Alps over the last 6400 years. We combined data on past and present plant species assemblages along with sedimentological and geochemical records to assess the relative impact of human activities through pastoralism, and abiotic factors (temperature and soil evolution). Over the last 6400 years, we identified significant variation in plant communities, mostly related to soil evolution and pastoral activities. An abrupt vegetational change corresponding to the establishment of an agropastoral landscape was detected during the Late Holocene, approximately 4500 years ago, with the replacement of mountain forests and tall-herb communities by heathlands and grazed lands. Our results highlight the importance of anthropogenic activities in mountain areas for the long-term evolution of local plant assemblages. SedaDNA data, associated with other paleoenvironmental proxies and present plant assemblages, appear to be a relevant tool for reconstruction of plant cover history. Their integration, in conjunction with classical tools, offers interesting perspectives for a better understanding of long-term ecosystem dynamics under the influence of human-induced and environmental drivers.","35","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","anthropocene | environmental DNA | landscape history | metabarcoding | paleoecology | pastoralism","20297","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1135","24","7","25735209",NA,NA,NA,2015

Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) have been discovered in over 45 primate species; however, the pathogenic potential of most SIV strains remains unknown due to difficulties inherent in observing wild populations. Because those SIV infections that are pathogenic have been shown to induce changes in the host's gut microbiome, monitoring the microbiota present in faecal samples can provide a noninvasive means for studying the effects of SIV infection on the health of wild-living primates. Here, we examine the effects of SIVgor, a close relative of SIVcpz of chimpanzees and HIV-1 of humans, on the gut bacterial communities residing within wild gorillas, revealing that gorilla gut microbiomes are exceptionally robust to SIV infection. In contrast to the microbiomes of HIV-1-infected humans and SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees, SIVgor-infected gorilla microbiomes exhibit neither rises in the frequencies of opportunistic pathogens nor elevated rates of microbial turnover within individual hosts. Regardless of SIV infection status, gorilla microbiomes assort into enterotypes, one of which is compositionally analogous to those identified in humans and chimpanzees. The other gorilla enterotype appears specialized for a leaf-based diet and is enriched in environmentally derived bacterial genera. We hypothesize that the acquisition of this gorilla-specific enterotype was enabled by lowered immune system control over the composition of the microbiome. Our results indicate differences between the pathology of SIVgor and SIVcpz/HIV-1 infections, demonstrating the utility of investigating host microbial ecology as a means for studying disease in wild primates of high conservation priority.","18","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","bacteria | coevolution | community ecology | conservation biology | metabarcoding | microbial biology","20297","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1138","24","3","25545295",NA,NA,NA,2015

Spatial patterns of microbial communities have been extensively surveyed in well-developed soils, but few studies investigated the vertical distribution of micro-organisms in newly developed soils after glacier retreat. We used 454-pyrosequencing to assess whether bacterial and fungal community structures differed between stages of soil development (SSD) characterized by an increasing vegetation cover from barren (vegetation cover: 0%/age: 10 years), sparsely vegetated (13%/60 years), transient (60%/80 years) to vegetated (95%/110 years) and depths (surface, 5 and 20 cm) along the Damma glacier forefield (Switzerland). The SSD significantly influenced the bacterial and fungal communities. Based on indicator species analyses, metabolically versatile bacteria (e.g. Geobacter) and psychrophilic yeasts (e.g. Mrakia) characterized the barren soils. Vegetated soils with higher C, N and root biomass consisted of bacteria able to degrade complex organic compounds (e.g. Candidatus Solibacter), lignocellulolytic Ascomycota (e.g. Geoglossum) and ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycota (e.g. Laccaria). Soil depth only influenced bacterial and fungal communities in barren and sparsely vegetated soils. These changes were partly due to more silt and higher soil moisture in the surface. In both soil ages, the surface was characterized by OTUs affiliated to Phormidium and Sphingobacteriales. In lower depths, however, bacterial and fungal communities differed between SSD. Lower depths of sparsely vegetated soils consisted of OTUs affiliated to Acidobacteria and Geoglossum, whereas depths of barren soils were characterized by OTUs related to Gemmatimonadetes.

The SINVpositive mosquito Culiseta morsitans was identified by SNP analysis and sequencing. After whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the SINV Lövanger isolate was shown to be most closely similar to recent Finnish SINV isolates.

Therefore, a more efficient, cost-effective and sensitive method is needed. Here, we present a method for identification and quantification of airborne pollen using DNA sequencing. Pollen is collected from ambient air using standard techniques. DNA is extracted from the collected pollen, and a fragment of the chloroplast gene trnL is amplified using PCR. The PCR product is subsequently sequenced on a next-generation sequencing platform (Ion Torrent). Amplicon molecules are sequenced individually, allowing identification of different sequences from a mixed sample. We show that this method provides an accurate qualitative and quantitative view of the species composition of samples of airborne pollen grains. We also show that it correctly identifies the individual grass genera present in a mixed sample of grass pollen, which cannot be achieved using microscopic pollen identification.

Climate change enhances habitat disturbance which facilitates the establishment of invasive species, which in turn provides opportunities for hybridization and introgression. These effects influence local biodiversity that can be tracked through genetic and genomic approaches. Metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches provide a way of monitoring some types of communities under climate change for the appearance of invasives. Introgression and hybridization can be followed by the analysis of entire genomes so that rapidly changing areas of the genome are identified and instances of genetic pollution monitored. Genomic markers enable accurate tracking of invasive species' geographic origin well beyond what was previously possible. New genomic tools are promoting fresh insights into classic questions about invading organisms under climate change, such as the role of genetic variation, local adaptation and climate pre-adaptation in successful invasions. These tools are providing managers with often more effective means to identify potential threats, improve surveillance and assess impacts on communities. We provide a framework for the application of genomic techniques within a management context and also indicate some important limitations in what can be achieved.","66","Journal","re","Review","100","6","Adaptation | Admixture | Climate change | Decision framework | Genomics | Hybridization | Invasive species | Management","19400157205","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1142","8","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,2015

Further, many singletons clustered into rare OTUs from other datasets highlighting their overlap across datasets or the poor performance of clustering algorithms.

By concatenating assemblies from three de novo assemblers, we obtained high-quality mitogenomes for all 49 pooled taxa, with 36 species >15 kb and the remaining >10 kb, including 20 complete mitogenomes and nearly all protein coding genes (99.6%). The assembly quality was carefully validated with Sanger sequences, reference genomes and conservativeness of protein coding genes across taxa. The new method was effective even for closely related taxa, e.g. three Drosophila spp., demonstrating its broad utility for biodiversity research and mito-phylogenomics. Finally, the in silicosimulation showed that by recruiting multiple mito-loci, taxon detection was improved at a fixed sequencing depth. Combined, these results demonstrate the plausibility of a multi-locus mito-metagenomics approach as the next phase of the current single-locus metabarcoding method.","118","Journal","ar","Article","100","11",NA,"14204","undefined","Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China","1","TRUE","1144","42","22","25294837","e166","MOST",NA,2014

Given that the majority of tropical landscapes have been or will likely be logged, the protection of biodiversity within tropical forests thus depends on whether species can persist in these economically exploited lands, and if species cannot persist, whether we can protect enough primary forest from logging and conversion. However, our knowledge of the impact of logging and conversion on biodiversity is limited to a few taxa, often sampled in different locations with complex land-use histories, hampering attempts to plan cost-effective conservation strategies and to draw conclusions across taxa. Spanning a land-use gradient of primary forest, once- and twice-logged forests, and oil palm plantations, we used traditional sampling and DNA metabarcoding to compile an extensive data set in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo for nine vertebrate and invertebrate taxa to quantify the biological impacts of logging and oil palm, develop cost-effective methods of protecting biodiversity, and examine whether there is congruence in response among taxa. Logged forests retained high species richness, including, on average, 70% of species found in primary forest. In contrast, conversion to oil palm dramatically reduces species richness, with significantly fewer primary-forest species than found on logged forest transects for seven taxa.Using a systematic conservation planning analysis, we show that efficient protection of primary-forest species is achieved with land portfolios that include a large proportion of logged-forest plots. Protecting logged forests is thus a cost-effective method of protecting an ecologically and taxonomically diverse range of species, particularly when conservation budgets are limited. Six indicator groups (birds, leaf-litter ants, beetles, aerial hymenopterans, flies, and true bugs) proved to be consistently good predictors of the response of the other taxa to logging and oil palm. Our results confidently establish the high conservation value of logged forests and the low value of oil palm. Cross-taxon congruence in responses to disturbance also suggests that the practice of focusing on key indicator taxa yields important information of general biodiversity in studies of logging and oil palm.","40","Journal","ar","Article","100","17","Cost-effective conservation | Indicator taxa | Oil palm plantation agriculture | Sabah, Malaysian Borneo | Selective logging | Southeast Asia | Timber concessions | Tropical rain forest","20287","0902281081","Chinese Academy of Sciences","0","FALSE","1145","24","8","29185670",NA,"CAS",NA,2014

Aim: Meiofaunal communities that inhabit the marine benthos offer unique opportunities to simultaneously study the macroecology of numerous phyla that exhibit different life-history strategies. Here, we ask: (1) if the macroecology of meiobenthic communities is explained mainly by dispersal constraints or by environmental conditions; and (2) if levels of meiofaunal diversity surpass existing estimates based on morphological taxonomy. Location: UK and mainland European coast. Methods: Next-generation sequencing techniques (NGS; Roche 454 FLX platform) using 18S nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene. Pyrosequences were analysed using AmpliconNoise followed by chimera removal using Perseus. Results: Rarefaction curves revealed that sampling saturation was only reached at 15% of sites, highlighting that the bulk of meiofaunal diversity is yet to be discovered. Overall, 1353 OTUs were recovered and assigned to 23 different phyla. The majority of sampled sites had c. 60-70 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) per site, indicating high levels of beta diversity. The environmental parameters that best explained community structure were seawater temperature, geographical distance and sediment size, but most of the variability (R2=70%-80%) remains unexplained. Main conclusions: High percentages of endemic OTUs suggest that meiobenthic community composition is partly niche-driven, as observed in larger organisms, but also shares macroecological features of microorganisms by showing high levels of cosmopolitanism (albeit on a much smaller scale). Meiobenthic communities exhibited patterns of isolation by distance as well as associations between niche, latitude and temperature, indicating that meiobenthic communities result from a combination of niche assembly and dispersal processes. Conversely, isolation-by-distance patterns were not identified in the featured protists, suggesting that animals and protists adhere to radically different macroecological processes, linked to life-history strategies.","45","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","454 Roche pyrosequencing | Environmental metagenetics | Macroecology | Marine eukaryotes | Meiofauna | Metabarcoding | Microscopic biodiversity | Next-generation sequencing","22044","EP/H003851/1","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","1","TRUE","1147","23","11",NA,NA,"BBSRC",NA,2014

DNA metabarcoding based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) constitutes the latest advancement in these efforts. Here we use NGS data from different sites to investigate the geographic range of six species of the diatom family Leptocylindraceae and to identify possible new taxa within the family. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analysed the V4 and V9 regions of the nuclear-encoded SSU rDNA gene region in the NGS database of the European ERA-Biodiversa project BioMarKs, collected in plankton and sediments at six coastal sites in European coastal waters, as well as environmental sequences from the NCBI database. All species known in the family Leptocylindraceae were detected in both datasets, but the much larger Illumina V9 dataset showed a higher species coverage at the various sites than the 454 V4 dataset. Sequences identical or similar to the references of Leptocylindrus aporus, L. convexus, L. danicus/hargravesii and Tenuicylindrus belgicus were found in the Mediterranean Sea, North Atlantic Ocean and Black Sea as well as at locations outside Europe. Instead, sequences identical or close to that of L. minimus were found in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Black Sea but not in the Mediterranean Sea, while sequences belonging to a yet undescribed taxon were encountered only in Oslo Fjord and Baffin Bay. Conclusions/Significance: Identification of Leptocylindraceae species in NGS datasets has expanded our knowledge of the species biogeographic distribution and of the overall diversity of this diatom family. Individual species appear to be widespread, but not all of them are found everywhere.

To help interpret environmental metabarcoding datasets, we investigated the intracellular diversity of the V4 and V9 regions of the 18S rRNA gene from Acantharia and Nassellaria (radiolarians) using 454 pyrosequencing. Individual cells of radiolarians were isolated, and PCRs were performed with generalist primers to amplify the V4 and V9 regions. Different denoising procedures were employed to filter the pyrosequenced raw amplicons (Acacia, AmpliconNoise, Linkage method). For each of the six isolated cells, an average of 541 V4 and 562 V9 amplicons assigned to radiolarians were obtained, from which one numerically dominant sequence and several minor variants were found. At the 97% identity, a diversity metrics commonly used in environmental surveys, up to 5 distinct OTUs were detected in a single cell. However, most amplicons grouped within a single OTU whereas other OTUs contained very few amplicons. Different analytical methods provided evidence that most minor variants forming different OTUs correspond to PCR and sequencing artifacts. Duplicate PCR and sequencing from the same DNA extract of a single cell had only 9 to 16% of unique amplicons in common, and alignment visualization of V4 and V9 amplicons showed that most minor variants contained substitutions in highly-conserved regions. We conclude that intracellular variability of the 18S rRNA in radiolarians is very limited despite its multi-copy nature and the existence of multiple nuclei in these protists.

For fungi, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region in the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operon has been accepted as the formal fungal barcode. Despite an increasing number of fungal metabarcoding studies, the amplification efficiency of primers is generally not tested prior to their application in metabarcoding studies. Some of the challenges that metabarcoding primers should overcome efficiently are the amplification of target DNA strands in samples rich in non-target DNA and environmental pollutants, such as humic acids, that may have been co-extracted with DNA. In the current study, three selected primer pairs were tested for their suitability as fungal metabarcoding primers. The selected primer pairs include two primer pairs that have been frequently used in fungal metabarcoding studies (ITS1F/ITS2 and ITS3/ITS4) and a primer pair (ITS86F/ITS4) that has been shown to efficiently amplify the ITS2 region of a broad range of fungal taxa in environmental soil samples. The selected primer pairs were evaluated in a 454 amplicon pyrosequencing experiment, real-time PCR (qPCR) experiments and in silico analyses. Results indicate that experimental evaluation of primers provides valuable information that could aid in the selection of suitable primers for fungal metabarcoding studies. Furthermore, we show that the ITS86F/ITS4 primer pair outperforms other primer pairs tested in terms of in silico primer efficiency, PCR efficiency, coverage, number of reads and number of species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) obtained.

Some bat species inhabiting locations with mild temperate winters forage during brief inter-torpor normothermic periods of activity. However, the winter diet of bats in mild temperate locations is studied infrequently. Although microscopic analyses of faeces have traditionally been used to characterise bat diet, recently the coupling of PCR with second generation sequencing has offered the potential to further advance our understanding of animal dietary composition and foraging behaviour by allowing identification of a much greater proportion of prey items often with increased taxonomic resolution. We used morphological analysis and Illumina-based second generation sequencing to study the winter diet of Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) and compared the results obtained from these two approaches. For the first time, we demonstrate the applicability of the Illumina MiSeq platform as a data generation source for bat dietary analyses.Results: Faecal pellets collected from a hibernation site in southern England during two winters (December-March 2009-10 and 2010-11), indicated that M. nattereri forages throughout winter at least in a location with a mild winter climate. Through morphological analysis, arthropod fragments from seven taxonomic orders were identified. A high proportion of these was non-volant (67.9% of faecal pellets) and unexpectedly included many lepidopteran larvae. Molecular analysis identified 43 prey species from six taxonomic orders and confirmed the frequent presence of lepidopteran species that overwinter as larvae.Conclusions: The winter diet of M. nattereri is substantially different from other times of the year confirming that this species has a wide and adaptable dietary niche. Comparison of DNA derived from the prey to an extensive reference dataset of potential prey barcode sequences permitted fine scale taxonomic resolution of prey species. The high occurrence of non-volant prey suggests that gleaning allows prey capture at low ambient temperatures when the abundance of flying insects may be substantially reduced. Interesting questions arise as to how M. nattereri might successfully locate and capture some of the non-volant prey species encountered in its faeces. The consumption of lepidopteran larvae such as cutworms suggests that M. nattereri eats agricultural pest species. © 2014 Hope et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","31","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Echolocation | Ecosystem services | Hibernation | Illumina MiSeq | Metabarcoding | Molecular diet analyses | Natterer's bat | Sensory ecology | Winter diet","130152","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1155","11","1",NA,"39",NA,NA,2014

Here, we hypothesized that the cover crop can significantly alter the diet of predators in agroecosystems. The cover crop Brachiaria decumbens is increasingly used in banana plantations to control weeds and improve physical soil properties. In this paper, we used a DNA metabarcoding approach for the molecular analysis of the gut contents of predators (based on mini-COI) to identify 1) the DNA sequences of their prey, 2) the predators of Cosmopolites sordidus (a major pest of banana crops), and 3) the difference in the specific composition of predator diets between a bare soil plot (BSP) and a cover cropped plot (CCP) in a banana plantation. The earwig Euborellia caraibea, the carpenter ant Camponotus sexguttatus, and the fire ant Solenopsis geminata were found to contain C. sordidus DNA at frequencies ranging from 1 to 7%. While the frequencies of predators positive for C. sordidus DNA did not significantly differ between BSP and CCP, the frequency at which E. caraibea was positive for Diptera was 26% in BSP and 80% in CCP; the frequency at which C. sexguttatus was positive for Jalysus spinosus was 14% in BSP and 0% in CCP; and the frequency at which S. geminata was positive for Polytus mellerborgi was 21% in BSP and 3% in CCP. E. caraibea, C. sexguttatus and S. geminata were identified as possible biological agents for the regulation of C. sordidus.

We validated this approach on 91 faeces of a large omnivorous mammal, the brown bear, using DNA metabarcoding markers targeting the plant, vertebrate and invertebrate components of the diet. We included internal controls in the experiments and performed PCR replication for accuracy validation in postsequencing data analysis. Using our multiplexing strategy, we significantly simplified the experimental procedure and accurately and concurrently identified different prey DNA corresponding to the targeted taxonomic groups, with =60% of taxa of all diet components identified to genus/species level. The systematic application of internal controls and replication was a useful and simple way to evaluate the performance of our experimental procedure, standardize the selection of sequence filtering parameters for each marker data and validate the accuracy of the results. Our general approach can be adapted to the analysis of dietary samples of various predator species in different ecosystems, for a number of conservation and ecological applications entailing large-scale population level diet assessment through cost-effective screening of multiple DNA metabarcodes, and the detection of fine dietary variation among samples or individuals and of rare food items. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","138","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","Chloroplast trnL (UAA) | Consumer-resource interactions | Internal controls | Internal transcribed spacer | Mitochondrial 12S and 16S genes | Ursus arctos","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1158","14","2","24128180",NA,NA,NA,2014

Advances in DNA sequencing can now provide a comprehensive view of benthic invertebrate diversity. The authors applied 454 pyrosequencing to examine the responses of benthic communities in microcosms exposed to sediments with elevated concentrations of triclosan, the endpoint being eukaryl communities that have successfully vertically migrated through the manipulated sediments. The biological communities associated with the 3 treatments (control triclosan, low triclosan [14mg/kg], and high triclosan [180mg/kg]) clustered into 3 groups: control/low (n=6 controls and 4 low), moderate (n=2 low), and high (n=5 high). One sample was discarded as an outlier. The most pronounced change as a response to triclosan was the loss of number of metazoan operational taxonomic units (OTUs), indicative of the control/low and moderate groups, with this being most evident in the range of taxa associated with the classes Chromadorea and Bivalvia and the phylum Kinorhyncha. The authors also describe a range of other taxa that aided discrimination between the groups; compare findings with traditionally obtained meio- and macrofaunal communities obtained from the same experiment; and illustrate some of the advantages and limitations associated with both the molecular and traditional approaches.

Studies of insect assemblages are suited to the simultaneous DNA-based identification of multiple taxa known as metabarcoding. To obtain accurate estimates of diversity, metabarcoding markers ideally possess appropriate taxonomic coverage to avoid PCR-amplification bias, as well as sufficient sequence divergence to resolve species. We used in silico PCR to compare the taxonomic coverage and resolution of newly designed insect metabarcodes (targeting 16S) with that of existing markers [16S and cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI)] and then compared their efficiency in vitro. Existing metabarcoding primers amplified in silico <75% of insect species with complete mitochondrial genomes available, whereas new primers targeting 16S provided >90% coverage. Furthermore, metabarcodes targeting COI appeared to introduce taxonomic PCR-amplification bias, typically amplifying a greater percentage of Lepidoptera and Diptera species, while failing to amplify certain orders in silico. To test whether bias predicted in silico was observed in vitro, we created an artificial DNA blend containing equal amounts of DNA from 14 species, representing 11 insect orders and one arachnid. We PCR-amplified the blend using five primer sets, targeting either COI or 16S, with high-throughput amplicon sequencing yielding more than 6 million reads. In vitro results typically corresponded to in silico PCR predictions, with newly designed 16S primers detecting 11 insect taxa present, thus providing equivalent or better taxonomic coverage than COI metabarcodes. Our results demonstrate that in silico PCR is a useful tool for predicting taxonomic bias in mixed template PCR and that researchers should be wary of potential bias when selecting metabarcoding markers.","93","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Environmental DNA | Insect | Metabarcoding | PCR bias","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1162","14","6","24751203",NA,NA,NA,2014

Now, sampling has become a rate-limiting step in biodiversity measurement, and in an effort to reduce turnaround time, we use arthropod samples from southern China and Vietnam to ask whether soil, leaf litter, and aboveground samples provide similar ecological information. A soil or leaf-litter sample can be collected in minutes, whereas an aboveground sample, such as from Malaise traps or canopy fogging, can require days to set up and run, during which time they are subject to theft, damage, and deliberate contamination. Here we show that while the taxonomic compositions of soil and leaf-litter samples are very different from aboveground samples, both types of samples provide similar ecological information, in terms of ranking sites by species richness and differentiating sites by beta diversity. In fact, leaf-litter samples appear to be as or more powerful than Malaise-trap and canopy-fogging samples at detecting habitat differences.

The measurement of species diversity represents a powerful tool for assessing the impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems. Traditionally, the impact of fish farming on the coastal environment is evaluated by monitoring the dynamics of macrobenthic infaunal populations. However, taxonomic sorting and morphology-based identification of the macrobenthos demand highly trained specialists and are extremely time-consuming and costly, making it unsuitable for large-scale biomonitoring efforts involving numerous samples. Here, we propose to alleviate this laborious task by developing protist metabarcoding tools based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) of environmental DNA and RNA extracted from sediment samples. In this study, we analysed the response of benthic foraminiferal communities to the variation of environmental gradients associated with salmon farms in Scotland. We investigated the foraminiferal diversity based on ribosomal minibarcode sequences generated by the Illumina NGS technology. We compared the molecular data with morphospecies counts and with environmental gradients, including distance to cages and redox used as a proxy for sediment oxygenation. Our study revealed high variations between foraminiferal communities collected in the vicinity of fish farms and at distant locations. We found evidence for species richness decrease in impacted sites, especially visible in the RNA data. We also detected some candidate bioindicator foraminiferal species. Based on this proof-of-concept study, we conclude that NGS metabarcoding using foraminifera and other protists has potential to become a new tool for surveying the impact of aquaculture and other industrial activities in the marine environment.","77","Journal","ar","Article","100","5","Bioinformatics/phyloinformatics | DNA barcoding | Ecotoxicology | Environmental DNA | Protists","11700154306","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1166","14","6","24734911",NA,NA,NA,2014

Two principal approaches are currently used to assign taxonomy to DNA sequences: DNA metabarcoding and metagenomics. When initially developed, each of these approaches mandated their own particular methods for data analysis; however, with the development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques they have begun to share many aspects in data set generation and processing. In this review we aim to define the current characteristics, goals and boundaries of each field, and describe the different software used for their analysis.

However, DNA analysis can also be applied to characterise the vast diversity of organisms present in soils. DNA metabarcoding and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) now offer a means to improve discrimination between forensic soil samples by identifying individual taxa and exploring non-culturable microbial species. Here, we compare the small-scale reproducibility and resolution of four molecular markers targeting different taxa (bacterial 16S rRNA, eukaryotic18S rRNA, plant trnL intron and fungal internal transcribed spacer I (ITS1) rDNA) to distinguish two sample sites. We also assess the background DNA level associated with each marker and examine the effects of filtering Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) detected in extraction blank controls. From this study, we show that non-bacterial taxa in soil, particularly fungi, can provide the greatest resolution between the sites, whereas plant markers may be problematic for forensic discrimination. ITS and 18S markers exhibit reliable amplification, and both show high discriminatory power with low background DNA levels. The 16S rRNA marker showed comparable discriminatory power post filtering; however, presented the highest level of background DNA. The discriminatory power of all markers was increased by applying OTU filtering steps, with the greatest improvement observed by the removal of any sequences detected in extraction blanks. This study demonstrates the potential use of multiple DNA markers for forensic soil analysis using HTS, and identifies some of the standardisation and evaluation steps necessary before this technique can be applied in casework. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","28","Journal","ar","Article","100","3","DNA | DNA metabarcoding | Forensic | High-throughput sequencing (HTS) | Metagenomics | Soil","5700191205","LP34107393","Australian Research Council","0","FALSE","1169","13",NA,"25151602",NA,NA,"S1872497314001641",2014

The prevailing paradigm, that such 'problem' animals approach settlements in search of food, ignores their social organization. Based on feces, we compared the diet of individual brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Sweden in relation to settlements. Nutritive quality was quantified using near-infrared spectroscopy, and food items were identified using a DNA metabarcoding approach. We analyzed the diet of 21 bears during 36 visits near (<150. m) settlements, and the corresponding diet when the same bears were in remote areas (>600. m from settlements; constituting 95% of bears' habitat use). The food-search hypothesis predicted a different and higher-quality diet when an individual was close to settlements than when in a remote area. Less than 1.9% of the variation in diet was associated with location, giving no support for the food-search hypothesis. However, females with yearlings had 5.1%. ±. 2.9 (SE) lower fecal protein content than adult males. In addition, females with young (cubs-of-the-year or yearlings) exploited slaughter remains less often than other bears. This suggests that the diet of predation-vulnerable bears may have been affected by despotic behavior of dominant conspecifics. We provide evidence against the paradigm that food search explained the occurrence of brown bears near settlements and suggest that predation-vulnerable bears may use habitation as a human shield without being food conditioned.

Recently developed techniques of DNA barcoding and next-generation sequencing (NGS) overcome previous limitations of evaluation of animal diet composition and together are promising method in molecular ecology. The objective was to compare standard ABI Sanger sequencing with new high throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) technique and the two selected plant barcodes (rbcL gene and trnL intron) in terms of the identification of host plant composition for the selected beetle species - the Centricnemus leucogrammus weevil. A comparison of two sequencing techniques showed that NGS (in this case Illumina) gave more exhaustive results than the Sanger method. Moreover, it was proven that a two-locus barcoding systems (rbcL and trnL) is sufficient for host plant identification from DNA isolated from insect bodies, at least at the genus level. A comparison of host plant composition among distant populations revealed that the studied species did not feed uniformly across its range. This probably reveals an ecological adaptation of geographically and genetically isolated populations. These findings, beside broadening basic knowledge on the use of barcoding and sequencing techniques for host plant identifications in insect populations, can have implications for conservation studies and strategies for rare and endangered species.","11","Journal","ar","Article","100","1","Centricnemus leucogrammus | Chloroplast DNA | Molecular ecology | Phytophagy | RbcL gene | trnL intron","15075","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1174","62","3","25412510",NA,NA,NA,2014

Coalescent-based species delimitation methods combine population genetic and phylogenetic theory to provide an objective means for delineating evolutionarily significant units of diversity. The generalised mixed Yule coalescent (GMYC) and the Poisson tree process (PTP) are methods that use ultrametric (GMYC or PTP) or non-ultrametric (PTP) gene trees as input, intended for use mostly with single-locus data such as DNA barcodes. Here, we assess how robust the GMYC and PTP are to different phylogenetic reconstruction and branch smoothing methods. We reconstruct over 400 ultrametric trees using up to 30 different combinations of phylogenetic and smoothing methods and perform over 2000 separate species delimitation analyses across 16 empirical data sets. We then assess how variable diversity estimates are, in terms of richness and identity, with respect to species delimitation, phylogenetic and smoothing methods. The PTP method generally generates diversity estimates that are more robust to different phylogenetic methods. The GMYC is more sensitive, but provides consistent estimates for BEAST trees. The lower consistency of GMYC estimates is likely a result of differences among gene trees introduced by the smoothing step. Unresolved nodes (real anomalies or methodological artefacts) affect both GMYC and PTP estimates, but have a greater effect on GMYC estimates. Branch smoothing is a difficult step and perhaps an underappreciated source of bias that may be widespread among studies of diversity and diversification. Nevertheless, careful choice of phylogenetic method does produce equivalent PTP and GMYC diversity estimates. We recommend simultaneous use of the PTP model with any model-based gene tree (e.g. RAxML) and GMYC approaches with BEAST trees for obtaining species hypotheses.","92","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","Coalescent | DNA barcoding | GMYC | Metabarcoding | Molecular dating | NGS | OTU | PTP | Speciation | Species delimitation","21100217611","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1175","5","10",NA,NA,NA,NA,2014

In particular, we now have the capacity in some systems to rapidly identify thousands of species-level interactions using non-invasive methods based on the detection of trace DNA. This represents a powerful tool for conservation biology, for example allowing the identification of species with particularly inflexible niches and the investigation of food-webs or interaction networks with unusual or vulnerable dynamics. As they develop, these analyses will no doubt provide significant advances in the field of restoration ecology and the identification of appropriate locations for species reintroduction, as well as highlighting species at ecological risk.

Such surveys rely heavily on robust genetic markers. Therefore, analysis of PCR efficiency and subsequent biodiversity estimation for different types of genetic markers and their corresponding primers is important. Here, we test the PCR efficiency and biodiversity recovery potential of three commonly used genetic markers - nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S), mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S ribosomal RNA (mt16S) - using 454 pyrosequencing of a zooplankton community collected from Hamilton Harbour, Ontario. We found that biodiversity detection power and PCR efficiency varied widely among these markers. All tested primers for COI failed to provide high-quality PCR products for pyrosequencing, but newly designed primers for 18S and 16S passed all tests. Furthermore, multiple analyses based on large-scale pyrosequencing (i.e. 1/2 PicoTiter plate for each marker) showed that primers for 18S recover more (38 orders) groups than 16S (10 orders) across all taxa, and four vs. two orders and nine vs. six families for Crustacea. Our results showed that 18S, using newly designed primers, is an efficient and powerful tool for profiling biodiversity in largely unexplored communities, especially when amplification difficulties exist for mitochondrial markers such as COI. Universal primers for higher resolution markers such as COI are still needed to address the possible low resolution of 18S for species-level identification. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","46","Journal","ar","Article","100","4","454 pyrosequencing | Aquatic community | Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) | Efficiency test | Mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (mt16S) | Small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S)","11700154306","undefined","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada","0","FALSE","1177","14","5","24655333",NA,"NSERC",NA,2014

Amplicons were pyrosequenced, and a total of 88 706 quality filtered reads were clustered into 1232 operational taxonomic units (OTU) across the six data sets.

There were only little differences in OTU richness observed between organic- (farmyard manure), mineral- and nonfertilized soils. However, the community compositions appeared to be strongly structured by organic fertilization in all data sets other than that generated using the universal eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene primers, whereas mineral fertilization had only a minor effect. In addition, a co-occurrence based network analysis revealed complex potential interaction patterns between OTUs from different trophic levels, for example between fungivorous flagellates and fungi.

Previous mycological works focused on macrofungi (e.g. agarics, polypores) and mycorrhizae in Alnus acuminata forests, while fungal diversity in other parts of the Yungas has remained mostly unexplored. We carried out Ion Torrent sequencing of ITS2 rDNA from soil samples taken at 24 sites along the entire latitudinal extent of the Yungas in Argentina. The sampled sites represent the three altitudinal forest types: the piedmont (400-700 m a.s.l.), montane (700-1500 m a.s.l.) and montane cloud (1500-3000 m a.s.l.) forests. The deep sequence data presented here (i.e. 4 108 126 quality-filtered sequences) indicate that fungal community composition correlates most strongly with elevation, with many fungi showing preference for a certain altitudinal forest type. For example, ectomycorrhizal and root endophytic fungi were most diverse in the montane cloud forests, particularly at sites dominated by Alnus acuminata, while the diversity values of various saprobic groups were highest at lower elevations. Despite the strong altitudinal community turnover, fungal diversity was comparable across the different zonal forest types. Besides elevation, soil pH, N, P, and organic matter contents correlated with fungal community structure as well, although most of these variables were co-correlated with elevation.

In traditional paleoecology, sediment-based pollen provides a means to define preanthropogenic impact conditions, but problems in establishing the exact provenance and ecologically meaningful levels of taxonomic resolution of the evidence are limiting. We explored the extent to which the use of sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) may complement pollen data in reconstructing past alpine environments in the tropics. We constructed a record of afro-alpine plants retrieved from DNA preserved in sediment cores from 2 volcanic crater sites in the Albertine Rift, eastern Africa. The record extended well beyond the onset of substantial anthropogenic effects on tropical mountains. To ensure high-quality taxonomic inference from the sedaDNA sequences, we built an extensive DNA reference library covering the majority of the afro-alpine flora, by sequencing DNA from taxonomically verified specimens. Comparisons with pollen records from the same sediment cores showed that plant diversity recovered with sedaDNA improved vegetation reconstructions based on pollen records by revealing both additional taxa and providing increased taxonomic resolution. Furthermore, combining the 2 measures assisted in distinguishing vegetation change at different geographic scales; sedaDNA almost exclusively reflects local vegetation, whereas pollen can potentially originate from a wide area that in highlands in particular can span several ecozones. Our results suggest that sedaDNA may provide information on restoration targets and the nature and magnitude of human-induced environmental changes, including in high conservation priority, biodiversity hotspots, where understanding of preanthropogenic impact (or reference) conditions is highly limited. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","36","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","Albertine Rift | High-elevation biodiversity | Lake sediment | Metabarcoding | SedaDNA | Vascular plants | Virunga volcanoes","17822","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1183","28","2","24372820",NA,NA,NA,2014

The Illumina sequencing platforms, with their much higher throughputs, could potentially reduce sequencing costs and improve sequence quality, but the associated shorter read length (typically <150 bp) has deterred their usage in next-generation-sequencing (NGS)-based analyses of eukaryotic biodiversity, which often utilize standard barcode markers (e.g. COI, rbcL, matK, ITS) that are hundreds of nucleotides long. We present a new Illumina-based pipeline to recover full-length COI barcodes from mixed arthropod samples. Our new assembly program, SOAPBarcode, a variant of the genome assembly program SOAPdenovo, uses paired-end reads of the standard COI barcode region as anchors to extract the correct pathways (sequences) out of otherwise chaotic 'de Bruijn graphs', which are caused by the presence of large numbers of COI homologs of high sequence similarity. Two bulk insect samples of known species composition have been analysed in a recently published 454 metabarcoding study (Yu et al. 2012) and are re-analysed by our analysis pipeline. Compared to the results of Roche 454 (c. 400-bp reads), our pipeline recovered full-length COI barcodes (658 bp) and 17-31% more species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from bulk insect samples, with fewer untraceable (novel) OTUs. On the other hand, our PCR-based pipeline also revealed higher rates of contamination across samples, due to the Illumina's increased sequencing depth. On balance, the assembled full-length barcodes and increased OTU recovery rates resulted in more resolved taxonomic assignments and more accurate beta diversity estimation. The HiSeq 2000 and the SOAPBarcode pipeline together can achieve more accurate biodiversity assessment at a much reduced sequencing cost in metabarcoding analyses. However, greater precaution is needed to prevent cross-sample contamination during field preparation and laboratory operation because of greater ability to detect non-target DNA amplicons present in low-copy numbers. © 2013 The Authors.

Clearly, adaptingaerodrome habitats to become less attractive to hazardous wildlife willreduce the incidence of collisions. Formulating effective habitat managementstrategies relies on accurate species identification of high-risk species.This can be successfully achieved for all strikes either through morphologyand/or DNA-based identifications. Beyond species identification, dietaryanalysis of birdstrike gut contents can provide valuable intelligence forairport hazard management practices in regards to what food is attractingwhich species to aerodromes. Here, we present birdstrike identification anddietary data from Perth Airport, Western Australia, an aerodrome that sawapproximately 140,000 aircraft movements in 2012. Next-generation highthroughput DNA sequencing was employed to investigate 77 carcasses from 16bird species collected over a 12-month period. Five DNA markers, whichbroadly characterize vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, were used totarget three animal mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and COI) and aplastid gene (trnL) from DNA extracted from birdstrike carcassgastrointestinal tracts.Results: Over 151,000 DNA sequences were generated, filtered and analyzed by afusion-tag amplicon sequencing approach. Across the 77 carcasses, the mostcommonly identified vertebrate was Mus musculus (house mouse).Acrididae (grasshoppers) was the most common invertebrate family identified,and Poaceae (grasses) the most commonly identified plant family. TheDNA-based dietary data has the potential to provide some key insights intofeeding ecologies within and around the aerodrome.Conclusions: The data generated here, together with the methodological approach, willgreatly assist in the development of hazard management plans and, incombination with existing observational studies, provide an improved way tomonitor the effectiveness of mitigation strategies (for example, netting ofwater, grass type, insecticides and so on) at aerodromes.

Current approaches either rely on simple sequence similarity thresholds (OTU-picking) or on complex and compute-intensive evolutionary models. The OTU-picking methods scale well on large datasets, but the results are highly sensitive to the similarity threshold. Coalescent-based species delimitation approaches often rely on Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and can therefore only be applied to small datasets. Results: We introduce the Poisson tree processes (PTP) model to infer putative species boundaries on a given phylogenetic input tree. We also integrate PTP with our evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA-PTP) to count the number of species in phylogenetic placements. We compare our approaches with popular OTU-picking methods and the General Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) model. For de novo species delimitation, the stand-alone PTP model generally outperforms GYMC as well as OTU-picking methods when evolutionary distances between species are small. PTP neither requires an ultrametric input tree nor a sequence similarity threshold as input. In the open reference species delimitation approach, EPA-PTP yields more accurate results than de novo species delimitation methods.

We analyzed diets of Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus) in three different habitats using a new method, DNA metabarcoding of stomach contents. To achieve detailed information on ingested vascular plants, bryophytes, and fungi, we amplified short fragments of chloroplast DNA (for plants; P6 loop of the trnL intron) and nuclear ribosomal DNA (for fungi; ITS1-region).

Vascular plant composition of the diets differed between heath, meadow, and wetland habitats, whereas bryophyte composition did not. Also, a variety of fungal taxa were retrieved, but as most of the identified taxa belong to micromycetes, they were unlikely to be consumed as food.

This new approach in combination with the use of generic barcoding primers (metabarcoding) has been suggested as complementary or alternative to traditional biodiversity monitoring in ancient soil sediments. However, the extent to which metabarcoding truly reflects plant composition remains unclear, as does its power to identify species with no pollen or macrofossil evidence. Here, we compared pollen-based and metabarcoding approaches to explore the Holocene plant composition around two lakes in central Scandinavia. At one site, we also compared barcoding results with those obtained in earlier studies with species-specific primers. The pollen analyses revealed a larger number of taxa (46), of which the majority (78%) was not identified by metabarcoding. The metabarcoding identified 14 taxa (MTUs), but allowed identification to a lower taxonomical level. The combined analyses identified 52 taxa. The barcoding primers may favour amplification of certain taxa, as they did not detect taxa previously identified with species-specific primers. Taphonomy and selectiveness of the primers are likely the major factors influencing these results. We conclude that metabarcoding from lake sediments provides a complementary, but not an alternative, tool to pollen analysis for investigating past flora. In the absence of other fossil evidence, metabarcoding gives a local and important signal from the vegetation, but the resulting assemblages show limited capacity to detect all taxa, regardless of their abundance around the lake. We suggest that metabarcoding is followed by pollen analysis and the use of species-specific primers to provide the most comprehensive signal from the environment. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","52","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","ancient DNA | barcoding | environmental DNA | palaeoecology | pollen","20297","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1194","22","13","23587049",NA,NA,NA,2013

We sequenced DNA amplified from faeces (scats) of captive harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) to investigate whether sequence counts could be used to quantify the seals' diet. Seals were fed fish in fixed proportions, a chordate-specific mitochondrial 16S marker was amplified from scat DNA and amplicons sequenced using an Ion Torrent PGM™. For a given set of bioinformatic parameters, there was generally low variability between scat samples in proportions of prey species sequences recovered. However, proportions varied substantially depending on sequencing direction, level of quality filtering (due to differences in sequence quality between species) and minimum read length considered. Short primer tags used to identify individual samples also influenced species proportions. In addition, there were complex interactions between factors; for example, the effect of quality filtering was influenced by the primer tag and sequencing direction. Resequencing of a subset of samples revealed some, but not all, biases were consistent between runs. Less stringent data filtering (based on quality scores or read length) generally produced more consistent proportional data, but overall proportions of sequences were very different than dietary mass proportions, indicating additional technical or biological biases are present.

Especially, the effect of food availability on food selection in natural habitats where a range of food items are available is unknown. We studied diets and selectivity of grey-sided voles (Myodes rufocanus) and tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus), key herbivores in European tundra ecosystems, using DNA metabarcoding, a novel method enabling taxonomically detailed diet studies. In order to cover the range of food availabilities present in the wild, we employed a large-scale study design for sampling data on food availability and vole diets. Both vole species had ingested a range of plant species and selected particularly forbs and grasses. Grey-sided voles also selected ericoid shrubs and tundra voles willows. Availability of a food item rarely affected its utilization directly, although seasonal changes of diets and selection suggest that these are positively correlated with availability. Moreover, diets and selectivity were affected by availability of alternative food items. These results show that the focal sub-arctic voles have diverse diets and flexible food preferences and rarely compensate low availability of a food item with increased searching effort. Diet diversity itself is likely to be an important trait and has previously been underrated owing to methodological constraints.

Identifying species from these samples relies on the ability to match sequences with reference barcodes for taxonomic identification. Unfortunately, most studies of environmental samples have targeted ribosomal markers, despite the fact that the mitochondrial Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I gene (COI) is by far the most widely available sequence region in public reference libraries. This is largely because the available versatile ("" universal"" ) COI primers target the 658 barcoding region, whose size is considered too large for many NGS applications. Moreover, traditional barcoding primers are known to be poorly conserved across some taxonomic groups.Results: We first design a new PCR primer within the highly variable mitochondrial COI region, the "" mlCOIintF"" primer. We then show that this newly designed forward primer combined with the "" jgHCO2198"" reverse primer to target a 313 bp fragment performs well across metazoan diversity, with higher success rates than versatile primer sets traditionally used for DNA barcoding (i.e. LCO1490/HCO2198). Finally, we demonstrate how the shorter COI fragment coupled with an efficient bioinformatics pipeline can be used to characterize species diversity from environmental samples by pyrosequencing. We examine the gut contents of three species of planktivorous and benthivorous coral reef fish (family: Apogonidae and Holocentridae). After the removal of dubious COI sequences, we obtained a total of 334 prey Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) belonging to 14 phyla from 16 fish guts. Of these, 52.5% matched a reference barcode (>98% sequence similarity) and an additional 32% could be assigned to a higher taxonomic level using Bayesian assignment.Conclusions: The molecular analysis of gut contents targeting the 313 COI fragment using the newly designed mlCOIintF primer in combination with the jgHCO2198 primer offers enormous promise for metazoan metabarcoding studies. We believe that this primer set will be a valuable asset for a range of applications from large-scale biodiversity assessments to food web studies. © 2013 Leray et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","233","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","DNA barcoding | Food web | Mini-barcode | Mitochondrial marker | Second generation sequencing | Trophic interactions","130152","undefined","Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation","1","TRUE","1197","10","1",NA,"34",NA,NA,2013

Twenty-six sediment samples dated 16000-32000 radiocarbon years old from two localities in Siberia were analysed for fungal ITS. We detected 75 fungal OTUs from 21 orders representing three phyla, although rarefaction analyses suggested that the full diversity was not recovered despite generating an average of 6677±3811 (mean±SD) sequences per sample and that preservation bias likely has considerable effect on the recovered DNA. Most OTUs (75.4%) represented ascomycetes. Due to insufficient sequencing depth, DNA degradation and putative preservation biases in our samples, the recovered taxa probably do not represent the complete historic fungal community, and it is difficult to determine whether the fungal communities varied geographically or experienced a composition shift within the period of 16000-32000 bp. However, annotation of OTUs to functional ecological groups provided a wealth of information on the historic communities. About one-third of the OTUs are presumed plant-associates (pathogens, saprotrophs and endophytes) typical of graminoid- and forb-rich habitats. We also detected putative insect pathogens, coprophiles and keratinophiles likely associated with ancient insect and herbivore faunas. The detection of putative insect pathogens, mycoparasites, aquatic fungi and endophytes broadens our previous knowledge of the diversity of fungi present in Beringian palaeoecosystems.

This is crucial to understand the role of these herbivores in the functioning of the rainforest ecosystems. We tested a non-invasive approach based on the high-throughput sequencing of environmental samples using small plant plastid sequences (the trnL P6 loop) and ribosomal ITS1 primers, referred to as DNA metabarcoding, to investigate the diet of the largest neotropical herbivore, the lowland tapir. Sequencing was performed on plant DNA extracted from tapir faeces collected at the Nouragues station, a protected area of French Guiana. In spite of a limited sampling, our approach reliably provided information about the lowland tapir's diet at this site. Indeed, 95.1% and 74.4% of the plant families and genera identified thanks to the trnL P6 loop, respectively, matched with taxa already known to be consumed by tapirs. With this approach we were able to show that two families and eight new genera are also consumed by the lowland tapir. The taxonomic resolution of this method is limited to the plant family and genera. Complementary barcodes, such as a small portion of ITS1, can be used to efficiently narrow identifications down to the species in some problematic families.

Primates are particularly vulnerable to habitat modifications. Most species persist in small fragments surrounded by complex human-mediated matrices whose structure and connectivity may strongly influence their dispersal and feeding behavior. Behavioral plasticity appears to be a crucial parameter governing the ability of organisms to exploit the resources offered by new matrix habitats and thus to persist in fragmented habitats. In this study, we were interested in the dietary plasticity of the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), an endangered species of lemur, found only in the Daraina region in north-eastern Madagascar. We used a DNA-based approach combining the barcoding concept and Illumina next-generation sequencing to (i) describe the species diet across its entire range and (ii) evaluate the influence of landscape heterogeneity on diet diversity and composition. Faeces from 96 individuals were sampled across the entire species range and their contents were analyzed using the trnL metabarcoding approach. In parallel, we built a large DNA reference database based on a checklist of the plant species of the Daraina region. Our results suggest that golden-crowned sifakas exhibit remarkable dietary diversity with at least 130 plant species belonging to 80 genera and 49 different families. We highlighted an influence of both habitat type and openness on diet composition suggesting a high flexibility of foraging strategies. Moreover, we observed the presence of numerous cultivated and naturalized plants in the faeces of groups living in forest edge areas. Overall, our findings support our initial expectation that P. tattersalli is able to cope with the current level of alteration of the landscape and confirm our previous results on the distribution and the dispersal ability of this species. © 2013 Quéméré et al.","37","Journal","ar","Article","100","14",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1200","8","3","23527060","e58971",NA,NA,2013

We analyse three data sets: two comprising ITS1 and ITS2 sequences of known taxonomic affiliations and a third comprising ITS1 and ITS2 environmental amplicon pyrosequencing data. Clustering analyses of sequences with known taxonomy using the bioinformatics pipeline ClustEx revealed that a 97% similarity cut-off represent a reasonable threshold for estimating the number of known species in the data sets for both ITS1 and ITS2. However, no single threshold value worked well for all fungi at the same time within the curated UNITE database, and we found that the Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) concept is not easily translated into the level of species because many species are distributed over several clusters.

Background: Next-generation-sequencing (NGS) technologies combined with a classic DNA barcoding approach have enabled fast and credible measurement for biodiversity of mixed environmental samples. However, the PCR amplification involved in nearly all existing NGS protocols inevitably introduces taxonomic biases. In the present study, we developed new Illumina pipelines without PCR amplifications to analyze terrestrial arthropod communities. Results: Mitochondrial enrichment directly followed by Illumina shotgun sequencing, at an ultra-high sequence volume, enabled the recovery of Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit 1 (COI) barcode sequences, which allowed for the estimation of species composition at high fidelity for a terrestrial insect community. With 15.5 Gbp Illumina data, approximately 97% and 92% were detected out of the 37 input Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), whether the reference barcode library was used or not, respectively, while only 1 novel OTU was found for the latter. Additionally, relatively strong correlation between the sequencing volume and the total biomass was observed for species from the bulk sample, suggesting a potential solution to reveal relative abundance. Conclusions: The ability of the new Illumina PCR-free pipeline for DNA metabarcoding to detect small arthropod specimens and its tendency to avoid most, if not all, false positives suggests its great potential in biodiversityrelated surveillance, such as in biomonitoring programs. However, further improvement for mitochondrial enrichment is likely needed for the application of the new pipeline in analyzing arthropod communities at higher diversity.","140","Journal","ar","Article","100","10","Abundance | Biomonitoring | Insect biodiversity | Metabarcoding | Mitochondria | Next-generation-sequencing | PCR-independent | Species richness","21100420802","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1205","2","1",NA,"4",NA,NA,2013

The analysis of pollen and macrofossils isolated from herbivore middens has been an invaluable source of information regarding past environments and the nature of ecological fluctuations within arid zones. The application of ancient DNA (aDNA) techniques to hot, arid zone middens remains unexplored. This paper attempts to retrieve and characterise aDNA from four Southern Hemisphere fossil middens; three located in hot, arid regions of Australia and one sample from South Africa's Western Cape province. The middens are dated to between 30,490 (±380) and 710 (±70) cal yr BP. The Brockman Ridge midden in this study is potentially the oldest sample from which aDNA has been successfully extracted in Australia. The application of high-throughput sequencing approaches to profile the biotic remains preserved in midden material has not been attempted to date and this study clearly demonstrates the potential of such a methodology. In addition to the taxa previously detected via macrofossil and palynological analyses, aDNA analysis identified unreported plant and animal taxa, some of which are locally extinct or endemic. The survival and preservation of DNA in hot, arid environments is a complex and poorly understood process that is both sporadic and rare, but the survival of DNA through desiccation may be important.

Environmental (eDNA) metabarcode surveys of DNA extracted from sediment samples are increasingly popular for surveying biodiversity. Most eDNA surveys use the nuclear gene-encoding small-subunit rDNA gene (18S) as a marker; however, different markers and metrics used for delimiting species have not yet been evaluated against each other or against morphologically defined species (morphospecies). We assessed more than 12,000 meiofaunal sequences of 18S and of the main alternatively used marker [Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) mtDNA] belonging to 55 datasets covering three taxonomic ranks. Our results show that 18S reduced diversity estimates by a factor of 0.4 relative to morphospecies, whereas COI increased diversity estimates by a factor of 7.6. Moreover, estimates of species richness using COI were robust among three of four commonly used delimitation metrics, whereas estimates using 18S varied widely with the different metrics. We show that meiofaunal diversity has been greatly underestimated by 18S eDNA surveys and that the use of COI provides a better estimate of diversity. The suitability of COI is supported by cross-mating experiments in the literature and evolutionary analyses of discreteness in patterns of genetic variation. Furthermore its splitting of morphospecies is expected from documented levels of cryptic taxa in exemplar meiofauna. We recommend against using 18S as a marker for biodiversity surveys and suggest that use of COI for eDNA surveys could provide more accurate estimates of species richness in the future.","150","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","DNA barcodes | Environmental DNA | Microinvertebrates | Species delimitation","21121","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1209","109","40","22988084",NA,NA,NA,2012

This is greatly impacting global biodiversity, economy and human health. Intriguingly, marine fish are largely surveyed using selective and invasive methods, which are mostly limited to commercial species, and restricted to particular areas with favourable conditions. Furthermore, misidentification of species represents a major problem. Here, we investigate the potential of using metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) obtained directly from seawater samples to account for marine fish biodiversity. This eDNA approach has recently been used successfully in freshwater environments, but never in marine settings. We isolate eDNA from 1/2-litre seawater samples collected in a temperate marine ecosystem in Denmark. Using next-generation DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, we obtain eDNA from 15 different fish species, including both important consumption species, as well as species rarely or never recorded by conventional monitoring. We also detect eDNA from a rare vagrant species in the area; European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). Additionally, we detect four bird species. Records in national databases confirmed the occurrence of all detected species. To investigate the efficiency of the eDNA approach, we compared its performance with 9 methods conventionally used in marine fish surveys. Promisingly, eDNA covered the fish diversity better than or equal to any of the applied conventional methods. Our study demonstrates that even small samples of seawater contain eDNA from a wide range of local fish species. Finally, in order to examine the potential dispersal of eDNA in oceans, we performed an experiment addressing eDNA degradation in seawater, which shows that even small (100-bp) eDNA fragments degrades beyond detectability within days. Although further studies are needed to validate the eDNA approach in varying environmental conditions, our findings provide a strong proof-of-concept with great perspectives for future monitoring of marine biodiversity and resources. © 2012 Thomsen et al.","292","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"10600153309","undefined",NA,"1","TRUE","1210","7","8","22952584","e41732",NA,NA,2012

Short DNA fragments allow the use of degraded DNA from environmental samples. All analyses included amplification using plant-specific versatile primers, sequencing and estimation of taxonomic diversity. We tested in three steps whether degraded DNA from dead material in soil has the potential of efficiently assessing biodiversity in different biomes. First, soil DNA from eight boreal plant communities located in two different vegetation types (meadow and heath) was amplified. Plant diversity detected from boreal soil was highly consistent with plant taxonomic and growth form diversity estimated from conventional above-ground surveys. Second, we assessed DNA persistence using samples from formerly cultivated soils in temperate environments. We found that the number of crop DNA sequences retrieved strongly varied with years since last cultivation, and crop sequences were absent from nearby, uncultivated plots. Third, we assessed the universal applicability of DNA metabarcoding using soil samples from tropical environments: a large proportion of species and families from the study site were efficiently recovered.

Using bioinformatic tools, we developed metabarcodes for several groups of organisms: fungi, bryophytes, enchytraeids, beetles and birds. The ability of these metabarcodes to amplify the target groups was systematically evaluated by (i) in silico PCRs using all standard sequences in the EMBL public database as templates, (ii) in vitro PCRs of DNA extracts from surface soil samples from a site in Varanger, northern Norway and (iii) in vitro PCRs of DNA extracts from permanently frozen sediment samples of late-Pleistocene age (~16 000-50 000 years bp) from two Siberian sites, Duvanny Yar and Main River.

While visual analyses and early molecular approaches are highly labour intensive and often lack resolution, recent DNA-based approaches potentially provide more accurate methods for dietary studies. A suite of approaches have been used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of DNA present in gut or faecal samples. In one approach, a standardized DNA region (DNA barcode) is PCR amplified, amplicons are sequenced and then compared to a reference database for identification. Initially, this involved sequencing clones from PCR products, and studies were limited in scale because of the costs and effort required. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has made this approach much more powerful, by allowing the direct characterization of dozens of samples with several thousand sequences per PCR product, and has the potential to reveal many consumed species simultaneously (DNA metabarcoding). Continual improvement of NGS technologies, on-going decreases in costs and current massive expansion of reference databases make this approach promising. Here we review the power and pitfalls of NGS diet methods. We present the critical factors to take into account when choosing or designing a suitable barcode.

We showed that combining DNA metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing facilitates the identification of earthworm species from soil samples. The first step of our experiments was to create a reference database of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 16S gene for 14 earthworm species found in the French Alps. Using this database, we designed two new primer pairs targeting very short and informative DNA sequences (about 30 and 70 bp) that allow unambiguous species identification. Finally, we analysed extracellular DNA taken from soil samples in two localities (two plots per locality and eight samples per plot). The two short metabarcode regions led to the identification of a total of eight earthworm species. The earthworm communities identified by the DNA-based approach appeared to be well differentiated between the two localities and are consistent with results derived from inventories collected using the handsorting method. The possibility of assessing earthworm communities from hundreds or even thousands of localities through the use of extracellular soil DNA will undoubtedly stimulate further ecological research on these organisms. Using the same DNA extracts, our study also illustrates the potential of environmental DNA as a tool to assess the diversity of other soil-dwelling animal taxa. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","55","Journal","ar","Article","100","7","cytochrome c oxidase | DNA metabarcoding | extracellular soil DNA | mitochondrial 16S ribosomal gene | mitochondrial DNA | species identification","20297","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1217","21","8","22250728",NA,NA,NA,2012

For carnivores, traditional diet analyses mostly rely upon the morphological identification of undigested remains in the faeces. Here, we developed a methodology for carnivore diet analyses based on the next-generation sequencing. We applied this approach to the analysis of the vertebrate component of leopard cat diet in two ecologically distinct regions in northern Pakistan. Despite being a relatively common species with a wide distribution in Asia, little is known about this elusive predator. We analysed a total of 38 leopard cat faeces. After a classical DNA extraction, the DNA extracts were amplified using primers for vertebrates targeting about 100 bp of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene, with and without a blocking oligonucleotide specific to the predator sequence. The amplification products were then sequenced on a next-generation sequencer. We identified a total of 18 prey taxa, including eight mammals, eight birds, one amphibian and one fish. In general, our results confirmed that the leopard cat has a very eclectic diet and feeds mainly on rodents and particularly on the Muridae family. The DNA-based approach we propose here represents a valuable complement to current conventional methods. It can be applied to other carnivore species with only a slight adjustment relating to the design of the blocking oligonucleotide. It is robust and simple to implement and allows the possibility of very large-scale analyses. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","121","Journal","ar","Article","100","9","blocking oligonucleotide | DNA metabarcoding | mitochondrial DNA | ribosomal DNA | species identification","20297","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1218","21","8","22250784",NA,NA,NA,2012

In addition to false-positive results, the amplification of contaminant DNA may cause false-negative results because of competition, or bias, during the PCR. In this study, we test the utility of human-specific blocking primers in mammal diversity analyses of ancient permafrost samples from Siberia. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) on human and mammoth DNA, we first optimized the design and concentration of blocking primer in the PCR. Subsequently, 454 pyrosequencing of ancient permafrost samples amplified with and without the addition of blocking primer revealed that DNA sequences from a diversity of mammalian representatives of the Beringian megafauna were retrieved only when the blocking primer was added to the PCR. Notably, we observe the first retrieval of woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) DNA from ancient permafrost cores. In contrast, reactions without blocking primer resulted in complete dominance by human DNA sequences. These results demonstrate that in ancient environmental analyses, the PCR can be biased towards the amplification of contaminant sequences to such an extent that retrieval of the endogenous DNA is severely restricted. The application of blocking primers is a promising tool to avoid this bias and can greatly enhance the quantity and the diversity of the endogenous DNA sequences that are amplified. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","50","Journal","ar","Article","100","8","blocking primer | contamination | environmental DNA | metabarcoding | PCR bias | pyrosequencing","20297","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1221","21","8","21988749",NA,NA,NA,2012

The use of metabarcoding technology, as presented in this document, offers promising perspectives in terms of better understanding the interactions between ingested grass, animals (mainly their eating habits) and end products (and their quality). This experiment was carried out in order to test this technology on the faeces of dairy cattle grazing on grassland with a diversified botanical composition. By sequencing plant DNA fragments found in tested faeces, it was possible to identify the full range of ingested taxons. Twice as many taxons were found in the faeces of cattle grazing on botanically rich grassland with a low stocking rate compared to faeces from cattle grazing on botanically poor grassland with a high stocking rate.","2","Journal","ar","Article","100","6","Botanical inventory | Dairy cow | Diet | Feeding behaviour | Forage species | Grassland | Grazing | Molecular marking | Stocking rate | Vegetation | Voluntary intake","21100818508","undefined",NA,"0","FALSE","1222","2012","209",NA,NA,NA,NA,2012

In this article, we present ecoPrimers, a software for identifying new barcode markers and their associated PCR primers. ecoPrimers scans whole genomes to find such markers without a priori knowledge. ecoPrimers optimizes two quality indices measuring taxonomical range and discrimination to select the most efficient markers from a set of reference sequences, according to specific experimental constraints such as marker length or specifically targeted taxa. The key step of the algorithm is the identification of conserved regions among reference sequences for anchoring primers. We propose an efficient algorithm based on data mining, that allows the analysis of huge sets of sequences. We evaluate the efficiency of ecoPrimers by running it on three different sequence sets: mitochondrial, chloroplast and bacterial genomes. Identified barcode markers correspond either to barcode regions already in use for plants or animals, or to new potential barcodes. Results from empirical experiments carried out on a promising new barcode for analyzing vertebrate diversity fully agree with expectations based on bioinformatics analysis. These tests demonstrate the efficiency of ecoPrimers for inferring new barcodes fitting with diverse experimental contexts. ecoPrimers is available as an open source project at: http://www.grenoble.prabi. fr/trac/ecoPrimers. © 2011 The Author(s).","105","Journal","ar","Article","100","6",NA,"14204","undefined","Alabama Commission on Higher Education","1","TRUE","1223","39","21","21930509",NA,NA,NA,2011
