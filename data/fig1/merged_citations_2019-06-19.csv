"79",NA,"dna barcode reference libraries for the monitoring of aquatic biota in europe gap analysis and recommendations for future work","effective identification of species using short dna fragments (dna barcoding and dna metabarcoding) requires reliable sequence reference libraries of known taxa. both taxonomically comprehensive coverage and content quality are important for sufficient accuracy. for aquatic ecosystems in europe, reliable barcode reference libraries are particularly important if molecular identification tools are to be implemented in biomonitoring and reports in the context of the eu water framework directive (wfd) and the marine strategy framework directive (msfd). we analysed gaps in the two most important reference databases, barcode of life data systems (bold) and ncbi genbank, with a focus on the taxa most frequently used in wfd and msfd. our analyses show that coverage varies strongly among taxonomic groups, and among geographic regions. in general, groups that were actively targeted in barcode projects (e.g. fish, true bugs, caddisflies and vascular plants) are well represented in the barcode libraries, while others have fewer records (e.g. marine molluscs, ascidians, and freshwater diatoms). we also found that species monitored in several countries often are represented by barcodes in reference libraries, while species monitored in a single country frequently lack sequence records. a large proportion of species (up to 50%) in several taxonomic groups are only represented by private data in bold. our results have implications for the future strategy to fill existing gaps in barcode libraries, especially if dna metabarcoding is to be used in the monitoring of european aquatic biota under the wfd and msfd. for example, missing species relevant to monitoring in multiple countries should be prioritized for future collaborative programs. we also discuss why a strategy for quality control and quality assurance of barcode reference libraries is needed and recommend future steps to ensure full utilisation of metabarcoding in aquatic biomonitoring.",2019
"80",NA,"fungal disease and temperature alter skin microbiome structure in an experimental salamander system","pathogens compete with host microbiomes for space and resources. their shared environment impacts pathogen-microbiome-host interactions, which can lead to variation in disease outcome. the skin microbiome of red-backed salamanders (plethodon cinereus) can reduce infection by the pathogen batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (bd) at moderate infection loads, with high species richness and high abundance of competitors as putative mechanisms. however, it is unclear if the skin microbiome can reduce epizootic bd loads across temperatures. we conducted a laboratory experiment to quantify skin microbiome and host responses (p. cinereus: nâ =â 87) to bd at mimicked epizootic loads across temperatures (13, 17 and 21â°c). we quantified skin microbiomes using 16s rrna gene metabarcoding and identified operational taxonomic units (otus) taxonomically similar to culturable bacteria known to kill bd (anti-bd otus). prior to pathogen exposure, temperature changed the microbiome (otu richness decreased by 12% and the abundance of anti-bd otus increased by 18% per degree increase in temperature), but these changes were not predictive of disease outcome. after exposure, bd changed the microbiome (otu richness decreased by 0.1% and the abundance of anti-bd otus increased by 0.2% per 1% increase in bd load) and caused high host mortality across temperatures (35/45: 78%). temperature indirectly impacted microbiome change and mortality through its direct effect on pathogen load. we did not find support for the microbiome impacting bd load or host survival. our research reveals complex host, pathogen, microbiome and environmental interactions to demonstrate that during epizootic events the microbiome will be unlikely to reduce pathogen invasion, even for putatively bd-resistant species.",2019

"82",NA,"categorization of species as native or nonnative using dna sequence signatures without a complete reference library","new genetic diagnostic approaches have greatly aided efforts to document global biodiversity and improve biosecurity. this is especially true for organismal groups in which species diversity has been underestimated historically due to difficulties associated with sampling, the lack of clear morphological characteristics, and/or limited availability of taxonomic expertise. among these methods, dna sequence barcoding (also known as ""dna barcoding"") and by extension, meta-barcoding for biological communities, has emerged as one of the most frequently utilized methods for dna-based species identifications. unfortunately, the use of dna barcoding is limited by the availability of complete reference libraries (i.e., a collection of dna sequences from morphologically identified species), and by the fact that the vast majority of species do not have sequences present in reference databases. such conditions are critical especially in tropical locations that are simultaneously biodiversity rich and suffer from a lack of exploration and dna characterization by trained taxonomic specialists. to facilitate efforts to document biodiversity in regions lacking complete reference libraries, we developed a novel statistical approach that categorizes unidentified species as being either likely native or likely nonnative based solely on measures of nucleotide diversity. we demonstrate the utility of this approach by categorizing a large sample of specimens of terrestrial insects and spiders (collected as part of the moorea biocode project) using a generalized linear mixed model (glmm). using a training data set of known endemic (nâ =â 45) and known introduced species (nâ =â 102), we then estimated the likely native/nonnative status for 4,663 specimens representing an estimated 1,288 species (412 identified species), including both those specimens that were either unidentified or whose endemic/introduced status was uncertain. using this approach, we were able to increase the number of categorized specimens by a factor of 4.4 (from 794 to 3,497), and the number of categorized species by a factor of 4.8 from (147 to 707) at a rate much greater than chance (77.6% accuracy). the study identifies phylogenetic signatures of both native and nonnative species and suggests several practical applications for this approach including monitoring biodiversity and facilitating biosecurity.",2019
"83",NA,"biotic factors influencing the unexpected distribution of a humboldt marten martes caurina humboldtensis population in a young coastal forest","pacific martens (martes caurina) are often associated with mature forests with complex structure for denning, resting, and efficient hunting. nonetheless, a small isolated population of the humboldt subspecies of pacific martens (martes caurina humboldtensis) occupies a narrow strip of young, coastal forest (< 70 years old) but not inland mature forest in the central oregon coast range. we examined factors contributing to this unexpected distribution of martens by 1) analyzing marten diets using dna metabarcoding to assess 90 scats, 2) using camera traps to assess differences in the relative abundances of prey, competitors, and predators across a coastal to inland gradient of vegetation types, and 3) quantifying differences in extent of fruit-producing shrubs and vegetation structure within vegetation types. diets of martens were diverse (12, 10, and 3 species of birds, mammals, and amphibians respectively), and most fall and winter scats contained fruit. voles, mice, and varied thrushes (ixoreus naevius) were dominant prey items. voles, mice, and most birds, but not varied thrushes, were more commonly observed in the coastal shrub-dominated forest than in inland forest. the coastal shrub-dominated forest had the highest diversity of vertebrates and potential prey overall. bobcats (lynx rufus), a key potential predator, were more commonly detected in inland forest. of potential competitors, western spotted skunks (spilogale gracilis) were more commonly detected in inland forest, with gray foxes (urocyon cinereoargenteus) and raccoons (procyon lotor) detected almost exclusively in coastal forests. vegetation in coastal forests appears to provide, at least seasonally, more prey and fruit, and more overhead shrub cover compared with inland forest. remaining plausible hypotheses for the restricted distribution of marten to coastal forests include increased prey, fruit, and overhead cover, and reduced predation risk from bobcats.",2019
"84",NA,"the effect of dissolved nickel and copper on the adult coral acropora muricata and its microbiome","the potential impacts of mining activities on tropical coastal ecosystems are poorly understood. in particular, limited information is available on the effects of metals on scleractinian corals which are foundation species that form vital structural habitats supporting other biota. this study investigated the effects of dissolved nickel and copper on the coral acropora muricata and its associated microbiota. corals collected from the great barrier reef were exposed to dissolved nickel (45, 90, 470, 900 and 9050â€¯î¼g ni/l) or copper (4, 11, 32 and 65â€¯î¼g cu/l) in flow through chambers at the national sea simulator, townsville, qld, australia. after a 96-h exposure dna metabarcoding (16s rdna and 18s rdna) was undertaken on all samples to detect changes in the structure of the coral microbiome. the controls remained healthy throughout the study period. after 36â€¯h, bleaching was only observed in corals exposed to 32 and 65â€¯î¼g cu/l and very high nickel concentrations (9050â€¯î¼g ni/l). at 96â€¯h, significant discolouration of corals was only observed in 470 and 900â€¯î¼g ni/l treatments, the highest concentrations tested. while high concentrations of nickel caused bleaching, no changes in the composition of their microbiome communities were observed. in contrast, exposure to copper not only resulted in bleaching, but altered the composition of both the eukaryote and bacterial communities of the coral's microbiomes. our findings showed that these effects were only evident at relatively high concentrations of nickel and copper, reflecting concentrations observed only in extremely polluted environments. elevated metal concentrations have the capacity to alter the microbiomes which are inherently linked to coral health.",2019

"86",NA,"one locus several primers a strategy to improve the taxonomic and haplotypic coverage in diet metabarcoding studies","in diet metabarcoding analyses, insufficient taxonomic coverage of pcr primer sets generates false negatives that may dramatically distort biodiversity estimates. in this paper, we investigated the taxonomic coverage and complementarity of three cytochrome c oxidase subunit i gene (coi) primer sets based on in silico analyses and we conducted an in vivo evaluation using fecal and spider web samples from different invertivores, environments, and geographic locations. our results underline the lack of predictability of both the coverage and complementarity of individual primer sets: (a) sharp discrepancies exist observed between in silico and in vivo analyses (to the detriment of in silico analyses); (b) both coverage and complementarity depend greatly on the predator and on the taxonomic level at which preys are considered; (c) primer sets' complementarity is the greatest at fine taxonomic levels (molecular operational taxonomic units [motus] and variants). we then formalized the ""one-locus-several-primer-sets"" (olsp) strategy, that is, the use of several primer sets that target the same locus (here the first part of the coi gene) and the same group of taxa (here invertebrates). the proximal aim of the olsp strategy is to minimize false negatives by increasing total coverage through multiple primer sets. we illustrate that the olsp strategy is especially relevant from this perspective since distinct variants within the same motus were not equally detected across all primer sets. furthermore, the olsp strategy produces largely overlapping and comparable sequences, which cannot be achieved when targeting different loci. this facilitates the use of haplotypic diversity information contained within metabarcoding datasets, for example, for phylogeography and finer analyses of prey-predator interactions.",2019
"87",NA,"taxonomic and functional characterization of the microbial community during spontaneous in vitro fermentation of riesling must","although there is an extensive tradition of research into the microbes that underlie the winemaking process, much remains to be learnt. we combined the high-throughput sequencing (hts) tools of metabarcoding and metagenomics, to characterize how microbial communities of riesling musts sampled at four different vineyards, and their subsequent spontaneously fermented derivatives, vary. we specifically explored community variation relating to three points: (i) how microbial communities vary by vineyard; (ii) how community biodiversity changes during alcoholic fermentation; and (iii) how microbial community varies between musts that successfully complete alcoholic fermentation and those that become 'stuck' in the process. our metabarcoding data showed a general influence of microbial composition at the vineyard level. two of the vineyards (4 and 5) had strikingly a change in the differential abundance of metschnikowia. we therefore additionally performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on a subset of the samples to provide preliminary insights into the potential relevance of this observation, and used the data to both investigate functional potential and reconstruct draft genomes (bins). at these two vineyards, we also observed an increase in non-saccharomycetaceae fungal functions, and a decrease in bacterial functions during the early fermentation stage. the binning results yielded 11 coherent bins, with both vineyards sharing the yeast bins hanseniaspora and saccharomyces. read recruitment and functional analysis of this data revealed that during fermentation, a high abundance of metschnikowia might serve as a biocontrol agent against bacteria, via a putative iron depletion pathway, and this in turn could help saccharomyces dominate the fermentation. during alcoholic fermentation, we observed a general decrease in biodiversity in both the metabarcoding and metagenomic data. unexpected micrococcus behavior was observed in vineyard 4 according to metagenomic analyses based on reference-based read mapping. analysis of open reading frames using these data showed an increase of functions assigned to class actinobacteria in the end of fermentation. therefore, we hypothesize that bacteria might sit-and-wait until saccharomyces activity slows down. complementary approaches to annotation instead of relying a single database provide more coherent information true species. lastly, our metabarcoding data enabled us to identify a relationship between stuck fermentations and starmerella abundance. given that robust chemical analysis indicated that although the stuck samples contained residual glucose, all fructose had been consumed, we hypothesize that this was because fructophilic starmerella, rather than saccharomyces, dominated these fermentations. overall, our results showcase the different ways in which metagenomic analyses can improve our understanding of the wine alcoholic fermentation process.",2019
"88",NA,"benthic diatom communities in an alpine river impacted by waste water treatment effluents as revealed using dna metabarcoding","freshwater ecosystems are continuously affected by anthropogenic pressure. one of the main sources of contamination comes from wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) effluents that contain wide range of micro- and macropollutants. chemical composition, toxicity levels and impact of treated effluents (tes) on the recipient aquatic ecosystems may strongly differ depending on the wastewater origin. compared to urban tes, hospital ones may contain more active pharmaceutical substances. benthic diatoms are relevant ecological indicators because of their high species and ecological diversity and rapid response to human pressure. they are routinely used for water quality monitoring. however, there is a knowledge gap on diatom communities' development and behavior in treated wastewater in relation to prevailing micro- and macropollutants. in this study, we aim to (1) investigate the response of diatom communities to urban and hospital tes, and (2) evaluate tes effect on communities in the recipient river. environmental biofilms were colonized in tes and the recipient river up- and downstream from the wwtp output to study benthic diatoms using dna metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (hts). in parallel, concentrations of nutrients, pharmaceuticals and seasonal conditions were recorded. diatom metabarcoding showed that benthic communities differed strongly in their diversity and structure depending on the habitat. te sites were generally dominated by few genera with polysaprobic preferences belonging to the motile guild, while river sites favored diverse communities from oligotrophic and oligosaprobic groups. seasonal changes were visible to lower extent. to categorize parameters important for diatom changes we performed redundancy analysis which suggested that communities within te sites were associated to higher concentrations of beta-blockers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in urban effluents vs. antibiotics and orthophosphate in hospital effluents. furthermore, indicator species analysis showed that 27% of otus detected in river downstream communities were indicator for urban or hospital te sites and were absent in the river upstream. finally, biological diatom index (bdi) calculated to evaluate the ecological status of the recipient river suggested water quality decrease linked to the release of tes. thus, in-depth assessment of diatom community composition using dna metabarcoding is proposed as a promising technique to highlight the disturbing effect of pollutants in alpine rivers.",2019
"89",NA,"environmental dna metabarcoding to detect pathogenic leptospira and associated organisms in leptospirosis endemic areas of japan","leptospires, which cause the zoonotic disease leptospirosis, persist in soil and aqueous environments. several factors, including rainfall, the presence of reservoir animals, and various abiotic and biotic components interact to influence leptospiral survival, persistence, and pathogenicity in the environment. however, how these factors modulate the risk of infection is poorly understood. here we developed an approach using environmental dna (edna) metabarcoding for detecting the microbiome, vertebrates, and pathogenic leptospira in aquatic samples. specifically, we combined 4 sets of primers to generate pcr products for high-throughput sequencing of multiple amplicons through next-generation sequencing. using our method to analyze the edna of leptospirosis-endemic areas in northern okinawa, japan, we found that the microbiota in each river shifted over time. operating taxonomic units corresponding to pathogenic l. alstonii, l. kmetyi, and l. interrogans were detected in association with 12 nonpathogenic bacterial species. in addition, the frequencies of 11 of these species correlated with the amount of rainfall. furthermore, 10 vertebrate species, including sus scrofa, pteropus dasymallus, and cynops ensicauda, showed high correlation with leptospiral edna detection. our edna metabarcoding method is a powerful tool for understanding the environmental phase of leptospira and predicting human infection risk.",2019
"90",NA,"how do richness and composition of diet shape trace metal exposure in a free living generalist rodent apodemus sylvaticus","exposure of terrestrial mammals to chemical contaminants like trace metals (tms) is considered to be mainly based on trophic transfer. although relationships between tm transfer to animals and identity of contaminated food have been studied, the variation of the tm transfer with respect to diet diversity has been poorly documented. in this study, the oral exposure to tms of wood mice apodemus sylvaticus was investigated with respect to both the number of different items, i.e., diet richness, and the identity of items determined by metabarcoding from their stomach content, i.e., diet composition. the results showed that consuming salicaceae, a known cadmium accumulator plant family, significantly increased exposure to cadmium and zinc. however, an increase in diet richness minimized exposure to cadmium when mice consumed salicaceae items. this strongly suggests that tm accumulator items can lead to a high oral exposure to tms but that such high exposure due to tm accumulator items can be "" diluted"" by diet richness due to other low accumulator items. our results clearly indicate that both the presence of certain items in the diet and diet richness are important determinants of exposure to tms in generalist animals, which matches the predictions of the "" diet dilution hypothesis"".",2019

"99",NA,"comprehensive biodiversity analysis via ultra deep patterned flow cell technology a case study of edna metabarcoding seawater","the characterization of biodiversity is a crucial element of ecological investigations as well as environmental assessment and monitoring activities. increasingly, amplicon-based environmental dna metabarcoding (alternatively, marker gene metagenomics) is used for such studies given its ability to provide biodiversity data from various groups of organisms simply from analysis of bulk environmental samples such as water, soil or sediments. the illumina miseq is currently the most popular tool for carrying out this work, but we set out to determine whether typical studies were reading enough dna to detect rare organisms (i.e., those that may be of greatest interest such as endangered or invasive species) present in the environment. we collected sea water samples along two transects in conception bay, newfoundland and analyzed them on the miseq with a sequencing depth of 100,000 reads per sample (exceeding the 60,000 per sample that is typical of similar studies). we then analyzed these same samples on illumina's newest high-capacity platform, the novaseq, at a depth of 7 million reads per sample. not surprisingly, the novaseq detected many more taxa than the miseq thanks to its much greater sequencing depth. however, contrary to our expectations this pattern was true even in depth-for-depth comparisons. in other words, the novaseq can detect more dna sequence diversity within samples than the miseq, even at the exact same sequencing depth. even when samples were reanalyzed on the miseq with a sequencing depth of 1 million reads each, the miseq's ability to detect new sequences plateaued while the novaseq continued to detect new sequence variants. these results have important biological implications. the novaseq found 40% more metazoan families in this environment than the miseq, including some of interest such as marine mammals and bony fish so the real-world implications of these findings are significant. these results are most likely associated to the advances incorporated in theâ novaseq, especially aâ patterned flow cell, which prevents similar sequences that are neighbours on the flow cell (common in metabarcoding studies) from being erroneously merged into single spots by the sequencing instrument. this study sets the stage for incorporating edna metabarcoding in comprehensive analysis of oceanic samples in a wide range of ecological and environmental investigations.",2019
"100",NA,"changes in fungal communities across a forest disturbance gradient","deforestation has a substantial impact on aboveground biodiversity, but the response of belowground soil fungi remains poorly understood. in a tropical montane rainforest in southwestern china, plots were established along a forest degradation gradient ranging from mature and regenerated forests to open land to examine the impacts of forest degradation and deforestation on ecosystem diversity and function. here, we evaluated the changes in belowground fungal diversity and community composition using a metabarcoding approach. soil saprotrophic fungal richness declined with increasing forest disturbance. for example, penicillium spp. (phosphorus [p]-solubilizing fungi) dominated in mature forest but were less abundant in regenerating forests and showed the lowest abundance in open land sites. conversely, the abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi increased along the disturbance gradient. the decline in soil saprophytic fungi may be a direct result of forest disturbance or it may be associated with increased availability of soil phosphorus indirectly through an increase in soil ph. the increase in abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi may be related to reduced competition with saprotrophic fungi, changes in microclimate, or increased spore rain. these results demonstrate a loss of dominant p-solubilizing saprotrophic fungi along the disturbance gradient, indicating a change from soil p limitation in mature tropical forests to soil c limitation in deforested sites. the increased prevalence of pathogenic fungi may inhibit plant succession following deforestation. overall, this research demonstrates that soil fungi can be used as a sensitive indicator for soil health to evaluate the consequences of forest disturbance.importance the soil fungal functional group changes in response to forest disturbance and indicates a close interaction between the aboveground plant community and the belowground soil biological community. soil saprotrophic fungi declined in relative abundance with increasing forest disturbance. at the same time, the relative abundance of facultative pathogenic fungi increased. the loss of saprotrophic fungal richness and abundance may have been a direct result of forest disturbance or an indirect result of changes in soil ph and soil p. furthermore, the dominant p-solubilizing saprotrophic fungi were replaced by diverse facultative pathogenic fungi, which have weaker c decomposition ability. these changes potentially indicate a shift from soil phosphate limitation to carbon limitation following deforestation. this study suggests that changes in fungal functional group composition can be used as an indicator of the effects of forest disturbance on soil carbon and nutrients.",2019

"106",NA,"molecular diet analysis finds an insectivorous desert bat community dominated by resource sharing despite diverse echolocation and foraging strategies","interspecific differences in traits can alter the relative niche use of species within the same environment. bats provide an excellent model to study niche use because they use a wide variety of behavioral, acoustic, and morphological traits that may lead to multi-species, functional groups. predatory bats have been classified by their foraging location (edge, clutter, open space), ability to use aerial hawking or substrate gleaning and echolocation call design and flexibility, all of which may dictate their prey use. for example, high frequency, broadband calls do not travel far but offer high object resolution while high intensity, low frequency calls travel further but provide lower resolution. because these behaviors can be flexible, four behavioral categories have been proposed: (a) gleaning, (b) behaviorally flexible (gleaning and hawking), (c) clutter-tolerant hawking, and (d) open space hawking. many recent studies of diet in bats use molecular tools to identify prey but mainly focus on one or two species in isolation; few studies provide evidence for substantial differences in prey use despite the many behavioral, acoustic, and morphological differences. here, we analyze the diet of 17 sympatric species in the chihuahuan desert and test the hypothesis that peak echolocation frequency and behavioral categories are linked to differences in diet. we find no significant correlation between dietary richness and echolocation peak frequency though it spanned close to 100â khz across species. our data, however, suggest that bats which use both gleaning and hawking strategies have the broadest diets and are most differentiated from clutter-tolerant aerial hawking species.",2019

"152",NA,"species level biodiversity assessment using marine environmental dna metabarcoding requires protocol optimization and standardization","dna extraction from environmental samples (environmental dna; edna) for metabarcoding-based biodiversity studies is gaining popularity as a noninvasive, time-efficient, and cost-effective monitoring tool. the potential benefits are promising for marine conservation, as the marine biome is frequently under-surveyed due to its inaccessibility and the consequent high costs involved. with increasing numbers of edna-related publications have come a wide array of capture and extraction methods. without visual species confirmation, inconsistent use of laboratory protocols hinders comparability between studies because the efficiency of target dna isolation may vary. we determined an optimal protocol (capture and extraction) for marine edna research based on total dna yield measurements by comparing commonly employed methods of seawater filtering and dna isolation. we compared metabarcoding results of both targeted (small taxonomic group with species-level assignment) and universal (broad taxonomic group with genus/family-level assignment) approaches obtained from replicates treated with the optimal and a low-performance capture and extraction protocol to determine the impact of protocol choice and dna yield on biodiversity detection. filtration through cellulose-nitrate membranes and extraction with qiagen's dneasy blood & tissue kit outperformed other combinations of capture and extraction methods, showing a ninefold improvement in dna yield over the poorest performing methods. use of optimized protocols resulted in a significant increase in otu and species richness for targeted metabarcoding assays. however, changing protocols made little difference to the otu and taxon richness obtained using universal metabarcoding assays. our results demonstrate an increased risk of false-negative species detection for targeted edna approaches when protocols with poor dna isolation efficacy are employed. appropriate optimization is therefore essential for edna monitoring to remain a powerful, efficient, and relatively cheap method for biodiversity assessments. for seawater, we advocate filtration through cellulose-nitrate membranes and extraction with qiagen's dneasy blood & tissue kit or phenol-chloroform-isoamyl for successful implementation of edna multi-marker metabarcoding surveys.",2019

"161",NA,"metabarcoding a diverse arthropod mock community","although dna metabarcoding is an attractive approach for monitoring biodiversity, it is often difficult to detect all the species present in a bulk sample. in particular, sequence recovery for a given species depends on its biomass and mitome copy number as well as the primer set employed for pcr. to examine these variables, we constructed a mock community of terrestrial arthropods comprised of 374 species. we used this community to examine how species recovery was impacted when amplicon pools were constructed in four ways. the first two protocols involved the construction of bulk dna extracts from different body segments (bulk abdomen, bulk leg). the other protocols involved the production of dna extracts from single legs which were then merged prior to pcr (composite leg) or pcr-amplified separately (single leg) and then pooled. the amplicons generated by these four treatments were then sequenced on three platforms (illumina miseq, ion torrent pgm and ion torrent s5). the choice of sequencing platform did not substantially influence species recovery, although the miseq delivered the highest sequence quality. as expected, species recovery was most efficient from the single leg treatment because amplicon abundance varied little among taxa. among the three treatments where pcr occurred after pooling, the bulk abdomen treatment produced a more uniform read abundance than the bulk leg or composite leg treatment. primer choice also influenced species recovery and evenness. our results reveal how variation in protocols can have substantial impacts on perceived diversity unless sequencing coverage is sufficient to reach an asymptote.",2019

"184",NA,"copper affects composition and functioning of microbial communities in marine biofilms at environmentally relevant concentrations","copper (cu) pollution in coastal areas is a worldwide threat for aquatic communities. this study aims to demonstrate the usefulness of the dna metabarcoding analysis in order to describe the ecotoxicological effect of cu at environmental concentrations on marine periphyton. additionally, the study investigates if cu-induced changes in community structure co-occurs with changes in community functioning (i.e., photosynthesis and community tolerance to cu). periphyton was exposed for 18 days to five cu concentrations, between 0.01 and 10 î¼m, in a semi-static test. diversity and community structure of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms were assessed by 16s and 18s amplicon sequencing, respectively. community function was studied as impacts on algal biomass and photosynthetic activity. additionally, we studied pollution-induced community tolerance (pict) using photosynthesis as the endpoint. sequencing results detected an average of 9,504 and 1,242 otus for 16s and 18s, respectively, reflecting the high biodiversity of marine periphytic biofilms. eukaryotes represent the most cu-sensitive kingdom, where effects were seen already at concentrations as low as 0.01 î¼m. the structure of the prokaryotic part of the community was impacted at slightly higher concentrations (0.06 î¼m), which is still in the range of the cu concentrations observed in the area (0.08 î¼m). the current environmental quality standard for cu of 0.07 î¼m therefore does not seem to be sufficiently protective for periphyton. cu exposure resulted in a more cu-tolerant community, which was accompanied by a reduced total algal biomass, increased relative abundance of diatoms and a reduction of photosynthetic activity. cu exposure changed the network of associations between taxa in the communities. a total of 23 taxa, including taxa within proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, stramenopiles, and hacrobia, were identified as being particularly sensitive to cu. dna metabarcoding is presented as a sensitive tool for community-level ecotoxicological studies that allows to observe impacts simultaneously on a multitude of pro- and eukaryotic taxa, and therefore to identify particularly sensitive, non-cultivable taxa.",2018
"185",NA,"dead or alive or does it really matter level of congruency between trophic modes in total and active fungal communities in high arctic soil","describing dynamics of belowground organisms, such as fungi, can be challenging. results of studies based on environmental dna (edna) may be biased as the template does not discriminate between metabolically active cells and dead biomass. we analyzed ribosomal dna (rdna) and ribosomal rna (rrna) coextracted from 48 soil samples collected from a manipulated snow depth experiment in two distinct vegetation types in svalbard, in the high arctic. our main goal was to compare if the rdna and rrna metabarcoding templates produced congruent results that would lead to consistent ecological interpretation. data derived from both rdna and rrna clustered according to vegetation types. different sets of environmental variables explained the community composition based on the metabarcoding template. rdna and rrna-derived community composition of symbiotrophs and saprotrophs, unlike pathotrophs, clustered together in a similar way as when the community composition was analyzed using all otus in the study. mean otu richness was higher for rrna, especially in symbiotrophs. the metabarcoding template was more important than vegetation type in explaining differences in richness. the proportion of symbiotrophic, saprotrophic and functionally unassigned reads differed between rdna and rrna, but showed similar trends. there was no evidence for increased snow depth influence on fungal community composition or richness. our findings suggest that template choice may be especially important for estimating biodiversity, such as richness and relative abundances, especially in helotiales and agaricales, but not for inferring community composition. differences in study results originating from rdna or rrna may directly impact the ecological conclusions of one's study, which could potentially lead to false conclusions on the dynamics of microbial communities in a rapidly changing arctic.",2018

"197",NA,"silk properties and overwinter survival in gregarious butterfly larvae","all organisms are challenged by encounters with parasites, which strongly select for efficient escape strategies in the host. the threat is especially high for gregarious species entering immobile periods, such as diapause. larvae of the glanville fritillary butterfly, melitaea cinxia, spend the winter in diapause in groups of conspecifics each sheltered in a silk nest. despite intensive monitoring of the population, we have little understanding of the ecological factors influencing larval survival over the winter in the field. we tested whether qualitative and quantitative properties of the silk nest contribute to larval survival over diapause. we used comparative proteomics, metabarcoding analyses, microscopic imaging, and in vitro experiments to compare protein composition of the silk, community composition of the silk-associated microbiota, and silk density from both wild-collected and laboratory-reared families, which survived or died in the field. although most traits assessed varied across families, only silk density was correlated with overwinter survival in the field. the silk nest spun by gregarious larvae before the winter acts as an efficient breathable physical shield that positively affects larval survival during diapause. such benefit may explain how this costly trait is conserved across populations of this butterfly species and potentially across other silk-spinning insect species.",2018
"198",NA,"a broadly applicable coi primer pair and an efficient single tube amplicon library preparation protocol for metabarcoding","the nucleotide variation in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit i (coi) gene makes it ideal for assigning sequences to species. however, this variability also makes it difficult to design truly universal primers. here, we present the forward primer ""sauron-s878,"" specifically designed to facilitate library preparation for metabarcoding. this primer is modified to improve the coverage of terrestrial species compared to the primer mcoiintf, optimized for aquatic systems, which raised the in silico coverage from 74.4% to 98.3% of available ncbi sequences (perfect match in 3' region, up to three mismatches in remaining primer). when paired with the reverse primer ""jghco2198"" (fragment length ~313â bp), these primers amplified 98.4% of 255 tested dna extracts from various taxa, which are better than many other common coi barcoding primers. furthermore, a single-tube protocol was developed, wherein these primers amplify the target gene, and attach mids and illumina sequencing adapters in one reaction. this eliminates the need for re-amplification or enzymatic ligation during library preparation while keeping the flexibility to modularly combine primers and mids. using the single-tube approach, three replicates of three mock samples were sequenced on a miseq platform with no adverse effects compared to commercial nextera indexing kits. from this run, 75% of all included taxa could be recovered, with no considerable bias among taxonomic groups. despite the fact that 98.4% of the extracts were confirmed to amplify in vitro, this number was lower than expected. a reason for this discrepancy was a clear link between the relative concentration of a specific dna type in the template and the number of returned reads for this dna. we would argue that such a bias may be especially problematic in metabarcoding where samples usually contain trace dna in unknown amounts. however, how this affects the completeness of metabarcoding results has yet been poorly investigated.",2018
"199",NA,"responses of foraminifera communities to aquaculture derived organic enrichment as revealed by environmental dna metabarcoding","current monitoring methods to assess benthic impacts of marine finfish aquaculture are based on complex biological indices and/or geochemistry data. the former requires benthic macrofauna morpho-taxonomic characterization that is time- and cost-intensive, while the latter provides rapid assessment of the organic enrichment status of sediments but does not directly measure biotic impacts. in this study, sediment samples were collected from seven stations at six salmon farms in british columbia, canada, and analyzed for geochemical parameters and by edna metabarcoding to investigate linkages between geochemistry and foraminifera. sediment texture across farm sites ranged from sand to silty loam, while the maximum sediment pore-water sulphide concentration at each site ranged from 1,000 to 13,000â î¼m. foraminifera alpha diversity generally increased with distance from cage edge. adonis analyses revealed that farm site explained the most variation in foraminifera community, followed by sediment type, enrichment status, and distance from cage edge. farm-specific responses were observed in diversity analyses, taxonomic difference analyses, and correlation analyses. results demonstrated that species diversity and composition of foraminifera characterized by edna metabarcoding generated signals consistent with benthic biodiversity being impacted by finfish farming activities. this substantiates the validity of edna metabarcoding for augmenting current approaches to benthic impact assessments by providing more cost-effective and practicable biotic measures than traditional morpho-taxonomy. to capitalize on this potential, further work is needed to design a new nomogram that combines edna metabarcoding data and geochemistry data to enable accurate monitoring of benthic impacts of fish farming in a time- and cost-efficient way.",2019

"207",NA,"environmental dna a new low cost monitoring tool for pathogens in salmonid aquaculture","environmental dna (edna) metabarcoding is a relatively new monitoring tool featuring in an increasing number of applications such as the facilitation of the accurate and cost effective detection of species in environmental samples. edna monitoring is likely to have a major impact on the ability of salmonid aquaculture industry producers and their regulators to detect the presence and abundance of pathogens and other biological threats in the surrounding environment. however, for edna metabarcoding to develop into a useful bio-monitoring tool it is necessary to (a) validate that sequence datasets derived from amplification of metabarcoding markers reflect the true species' identity, (b) test the sensitivity under different abundance levels and environmental noise and (c) establish a low-cost sequencing method to enable the bulk processing of field samples. in this study, we employed an elaborate experimental design whereby different combinations of five biological agents were crossed at three abundance levels and exposed to sterile pre-filtered and unfiltered seawater, prior to coarse filtering and then edna ultrafiltration of the resultant material. we then benchmarked the low-cost, scalable, ion torrent sequencing method against the current gold-standard illumina platform for edna surveys in aquaculture. based on amplicon-seq of the 18s ssu rdna v9 region, we were able to identify two parasites (lepeophtheirus salmonis and paramoeba perurans) to species level, whereas the microalgae species prymnesium parvum, pseudo-nitzschia seriata, and p. delicatissima could be assigned correctly only to the genus level. illumina and ion torrent provided near identical results in terms of community composition in our samples, whereas ion torrent was more sensitive in detecting species richness when the medium was unfiltered seawater. both methods were able to reflect the difference in relative abundance between treatments in 4 out of 5 species when samples were exposed to the unfiltered seawater, despite the significant amount of background noise from both bacteria and eukaryotes. our findings indicate that edna metabarcoding offers significant potential in the monitoring of species harmful to aquaculture and for this purpose, the low-cost ion torrent sequencing is as accurate as illumina in determining differences in their relative abundance between samples.",2018

"209",NA,"environmental dna edna metabarcoding reveals strong discrimination among diverse marine habitats connected by water movement","while in recent years environmental dna (edna) metabarcoding surveys have shown great promise as an alternative monitoring method, the integration into existing marine monitoring programs may be confounded by the dispersal of the edna signal. currents and tidal influences could transport edna over great distances, inducing false-positive species detection, leading to inaccurate biodiversity assessments and, ultimately, mismanagement of marine environments. in this study, we determined the ability of edna metabarcoding surveys to distinguish localized signals obtained from four marine habitats within a small spatial scale (<5â km) subject to significant tidal and along-shore water flow. our edna metabarcoding survey detected 86 genera, within 77 families and across 11 phyla using three established metabarcoding assays targeting fish (16s rrna gene), crustacean (16s rrna gene) and eukaryotic (cytochrome oxidase subunit 1) diversity. ordination and cluster analyses for both taxonomic and otu data sets show distinct edna signals between the sampled habitats, suggesting dispersal of edna among habitats was limited. individual taxa with strong habitat preferences displayed localized edna signals in accordance with their respective habitat, whereas taxa known to be less habitat-specific generated more ubiquitous signals. our data add to evidence that edna metabarcoding surveys in marine environments detect a broad range of taxa that are spatially discrete. our work also highlights that refinement of assay choice is essential to realize the full potential of edna metabarcoding surveys in marine biodiversity monitoring programs.",2019

"211",NA,"plant nutrient resource use strategies shape active rhizosphere microbiota through root exudation","plant strategies for soil nutrient uptake have the potential to strongly influence plant-microbiota interactions, due to the competition between plants and microorganisms for soil nutrient acquisition and/or conservation. in the present study, we investigate whether these plant strategies could influence rhizosphere microbial activities via root exudation, and contribute to the microbiota diversification of active bacterial communities colonizing the root-adhering soil (ras) and inhabiting the root tissues. we applied a dna-based stable isotope probing (dna-sip) approach to six grass species distributed along a gradient of plant nutrient resource strategies, from conservative species, characterized by low nitrogen (n) uptake, a long lifespans and low root exudation level, to exploitative species, characterized by high rates of photosynthesis, rapid rates of n uptake and high root exudation level. we analyzed their (i) associated microbiota composition involved in root exudate assimilation and soil organic matter (som) degradation by 16s-rrna-based metabarcoding. (ii) we determine the impact of root exudation level on microbial activities (denitrification and respiration) by gas chromatography. measurement of microbial activities revealed an increase in denitrification and respiration activities for microbial communities colonizing the ras of exploitative species. this increase of microbial activities results probably from a higher exudation rate and more diverse metabolites by exploitative plant species. furthermore, our results demonstrate that plant nutrient resource strategies have a role in shaping active microbiota. we present evidence demonstrating that plant nutrient use strategies shape active microbiota involved in root exudate assimilation and som degradation via root exudation.",2018

"225",NA,"when to use next generation sequencing or diagnostic pcr in diet analyses","next-generation sequencing (ngs) is increasingly used for diet analyses; however, it may not always describe diet samples well. a reason for this is that diet samples contain mixtures of food dna in different amounts as well as consumer dna which can reduce the food dna characterized. because of this, detections will depend on the relative amount and identity of each type of dna. for such samples, diagnostic pcr will most likely give more reliable results, as detection probability is only marginally dependent on other copresent dna. we investigated the reliability of each method to test (a) whether predatory beetle regurgitates, supposed to be low in consumer dna, allow to retrieve prey sequences using general barcoding primers that co-amplify the consumer dna, and (b) to assess the sequencing depth or replication needed for ngs and diagnostic pcr to give stable results. when consumer dna is co-amplified, ngs is better suited to discover the range of possible prey, than for comparing co-occurrences of diet species between samples, as retested samples were repeatedly different in prey detections with this approach. this shows that samples were incompletely described, as prey detected by diagnostic pcr frequently were missed by ngs. as the sequencing depth needed to reliably describe the diet in such samples becomes very high, the cost-efficiency and reliability of diagnostic pcr make diagnostic pcr better suited for testing large sample-sets. especially if the targeted prey taxa are thought to be of ecological importance, as diagnostic pcr gave more nested and consistent results in repeated testing of the same sample.",2019

"255",NA,"fecal microbiota associated with phytohaemagglutinin induced immune response in nestlings of a passerine bird","the vertebrate gastrointestinal tract is inhabited by a diverse community of bacteria, the so-called gut microbiota (gm). research on captive mammalian models has revealed tight mutual interactions between immune functions and gm. however, our knowledge of gm versus immune system interactions in wild populations and nonmammalian species remains poor. here, we focus on the association between gm community structure and immune response measured via the phytohaemagglutinin (pha) skin swelling test in 12-day-old nestlings of a passerine bird, the barn swallow (hirundo rustica). the pha test, a widely used method in field ecoimmunology, assesses cell-mediated immunity. gm structure was inferred based on high-throughput 16s rrna sequencing of microbial communities in fecal samples. we did not find any association between pha response and gm diversity; however, our data revealed that the intensity of pha response was correlated with differences in gm composition at the whole-community level. ten bacterial operational taxonomic units corresponding to both putative commensal and pathogens were identified as drivers of the compositional variation. in conclusion, our study suggests existence of gm versus immune system interactions in a free-living nonmammalian species, which corresponds with previous research on captive vertebrates.",2018
"256",NA,"integrating complementary methods to improve diet analysis in fishery targeted species","developing efficient, reliable, cost-effective ways to identify diet is required to understand trophic ecology in complex ecosystems and improve food web models. a combination of techniques, each varying in their ability to provide robust, spatially and temporally explicit information can be applied to clarify diet data for ecological research. this study applied an integrative analysis of a fishery-targeted species group-plectropomus spp. in the central great barrier reef, australia, by comparing three diet-identification approaches. visual stomach content analysis provided poor identification with ~14% of stomachs sampled resulting in identification to family or lower. a molecular approach was successful with prey from ~80% of stomachs identified to genus or species, often with several unique prey in a stomach. stable isotope mixing models utilizing experimentally derived assimilation data, identified similar prey as the molecular technique but at broader temporal scales, particularly when prior diet information was incorporated. overall, caesionidae and pomacentridae were the most abundant prey families (>50% prey contribution) for all plectropomus spp., highlighting the importance of planktivorous prey. less abundant prey categories differed among species/color phases indicating possible niche segregation. this study is one of the first to demonstrate the extent of taxonomic resolution provided by molecular techniques, and, like other studies, illustrates that temporal investigations of dietary patterns are more accessible in combination with stable isotopes. the consumption of mainly planktivorous prey within this species group has important implications within coral reef food webs and provides cautionary information regarding the effects that changing resources could have in reef ecosystems.",2018
"257",NA,"the endangered northern bettong bettongia tropica performs a unique and potentially irreplaceable dispersal function for ectomycorrhizal truffle fungi","organisms that are highly connected in food webs often perform unique and vital functions within ecosystems. understanding the unique ecological roles played by highly connected organisms and the consequences of their loss requires a comprehensive understanding of the functional redundancy amongst organisms. one important, yet poorly understood, food web is that between truffle-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi and their mammalian consumers and dispersers. mammalian fungal specialists rely on fungi as a food source, and they consume and disperse a higher diversity and abundance of fungi than do mycophagous mammals with generalist diets. therefore, we hypothesize that mammalian fungal specialists are functionally distinct because they disperse a set of fungal taxa not fully nested within the set consumed by the combined generalist mammalian community (i.e., functional redundancy of fungal dispersal is limited). using high-throughput sequencing, we compared the fungal composition of 93 scats from the endangered fungal specialist northern bettong (bettongia tropica) and 120 scats from nine co-occurring generalist mammal species across three sites and three seasons. compared with other generalist mammals, b.â tropica consumed a more diverse fungal diet with more unique taxa. this aligns with our hypothesis that b.â tropica performs a unique dispersal function for ectomycorrhizal truffle fungi. additionally, modelling of mammalian extinctions predicted rapid loss of food web connections which could result in loss of gene flow for truffle taxa. our results suggest that this system is sensitive to the extinction of highly connected specialist species like b.â tropica and their loss could have consequences for ectomycorrhizal truffle fungal diversity. this suggests that the conservation of fungal specialists is imperative to maintaining ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and healthy plant-mycorrhizal relationships.",2018

"262",NA,"metabarcoding of shrimp stomach content harnessing a natural sampler for fish biodiversity monitoring","given their positioning and biological productivity, estuaries have long represented key providers of ecosystem services and consequently remain under remarkable pressure from numerous forms of anthropogenic impact. the monitoring of fish communities in space and time is one of the most widespread and established approaches to assess the ecological status of estuaries and other coastal habitats, but traditional fish surveys are invasive, costly, labour intensive and highly selective. recently, the application of metabarcoding techniques, on either sediment or aqueous environmental dna, has rapidly gained popularity. here, we evaluate the application of a novel, high-throughput dna-based monitoring tool to assess fish diversity, based on the analysis of the gut contents of a generalist predator/scavenger, the european brown shrimp, crangon crangon. sediment and shrimp samples were collected from eight european estuaries, and dna metabarcoding (using both 12s and coi markers) was carried out to infer fish assemblage composition. we detected 32 teleost species (16 and 20, for 12s and coi, respectively). twice as many species were recovered using metabarcoding than by traditional net surveys. by comparing and interweaving trophic, environmental dna and traditional survey-based techniques, we show that the dna-assisted gut content analysis of a ubiquitous, easily accessible, generalist species may serve as a powerful, rapid and cost-effective tool for large-scale, routine estuarine biodiversity monitoring.",2019
"263",NA,"is marine sediment the source of microbes associated with accelerated low water corrosion","accelerated low water corrosion (alwc) is a form of microbiologically influenced corrosion (mic) associated with the degradation of marine structures around the low tide water level. a better understanding of the role of microbes in this degradation and the source of these microbes is required to improve the prediction and mitigation of the costly failures occurring due to alwc. the microbial communities present in a sediment sample and on an alwc tubercle on adjacent steel sheet piling from a tidal estuary were studied using culture-based isolation and metabarcoding. a total of 43 pure cultures were isolated from the sediment using a variety of culture conditions. phylogenetic analysis of their 16s rrna genes placed them in the actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, and proteobacteria (alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria). 16s rrna gene metabarcoding of the sediment and tubercle revealed similar microbial groups at varying relative abundances. no deltaproteobacteria were isolated from the sediment but they were present in both samples according to metabarcoding and their high abundance (49.3%) in the tubercle could indicate an important functional role. although some sediment isolates and operational taxonomic units from the metabarcoding have previously been associated with surface colonisation or biofilm formation in mic, there was no strong evidence for the notion that the sediment adjacent to alwc was the source of tubercle microbes. further isolation strategies and functional investigations of representative bacteria at different stages of corrosion are being carried out for additional laboratory-based corrosion studies.",2019

"281",NA,"pollen metabarcoding as a tool for tracking long distance insect migrations","insects account for a large portion of earth's biodiversity and are key players for ecosystems, notably as pollinators. while insect migration is suspected to represent a natural phenomenon of major importance, remarkably little is known about it, except for a few flagship species. the reason for this situation is mainly due to technical limitations in the study of insect movement. here, we propose using metabarcoding of pollen carried by insects as a method for tracking their migrations. we developed a flexible and simple protocol allowing efficient multiplexing and not requiring dna extraction, one of the most time-consuming part of metabarcoding protocols, and apply this method to the study of the long-distance migration of the butterfly vanessa cardui, an emerging model for insect migration. we collected 47 butterfly samples along the mediterranean coast of spain in spring and performed metabarcoding of pollen collected from their bodies to test for potential arrivals from the african continent. in total, we detected 157 plant species from 23 orders, most of which (82.8%) were insect-pollinated. taxa present in africa-arabia represented 73.2% of our data set, and 19.1% were endemic to this region, strongly supporting the hypothesis that migratory butterflies colonize southern europe from africa in spring. moreover, our data suggest that a northwards trans-saharan migration in spring is plausible for early arrivals (february) into europe, as shown by the presence of saharan floristic elements. our results demonstrate the possibility of regular insect-mediated transcontinental pollination, with potential implications for ecosystem functioning, agriculture and plant phylogeography.",2019

"286",NA,"using noninvasive metagenomics to characterize viral communities from wildlife","microbial communities play an important role in organismal and ecosystem health. while high-throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and limited quantities of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. using samples from common vampire bats (desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. based on finding viral contamination in foetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in rnalater or another nonbiological medium. we recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral rna. results from a low-input rna library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal rna depletion and light dnase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments and time.",2019
"287",NA,"protists within corals the hidden diversity","previous observations suggested that microbial communities contribute to coral health and the ecological resilience of coral reefs. however, most studies of coral microbiology focused on prokaryotes and the endosymbiotic algae symbiodinium. in contrast, knowledge concerning diversity of other protists is still lacking, possibly due to methodological constraints. as most eukaryotic dna in coral samples was derived from hosts, protist diversity was missed in metagenome analyses. to tackle this issue, we designed blocking primers for scleractinia sequences amplified with two primer sets that targeted variable loops of the 18s rrna gene (18sv1v2 and 18sv4). these blocking primers were used on environmental colonies of pocillopora damicornis sensu lato from two regions with contrasting thermal regimes (djibouti and new caledonia). in addition to symbiodinium clades a/c/d, licnophora and unidentified coccidia genera were found in many samples. in particular, coccidian sequences formed a robust monophyletic clade with other protists identified in agaricia, favia, montastraea, mycetophyllia, porites, and siderastrea coral colonies. moreover, licnophora and coccidians had different distributions between the two geographic regions. a similar pattern was observed between symbiodinium clades c and a/d. although we were unable to identify factors responsible for this pattern, nor were we able to confirm that these taxa were closely associated with corals, we believe that these primer sets and the associated blocking primers offer new possibilities to describe the hidden diversity of protists within different coral species.",2018

"314",NA,"dna metabarcoding reveals changes in the contents of carnivorous plants along an elevation gradient","resource variation along abiotic gradients influences subsequent trophic interactions and these effects can be transmitted through entire food webs. interactions along abiotic gradients can provide clues as to how organisms will face changing environmental conditions, such as future range shifts. however, it is challenging to find replicated systems to study these effects. phytotelmata, such as those found in carnivorous plants, are isolated aquatic communities and thus form a good model for the study of replicated food webs. due to the degraded nature of the prey, molecular techniques provide a useful tool to study these communities. we studied the pitcher plant sarracenia purpurea l. in allochthonous populations along an elevational gradient in the alps and jura. we predicted that invertebrate richness in the contents of the pitcher plants would decrease with increasing elevation, reflecting harsher environmental conditions. using metabarcoding of the coi gene, we sequenced the invertebrate contents of these pitcher plants. we assigned molecular operational taxonomic units at ordinal level as well as recovering species-level data. we found small but significant changes in community composition with elevation. these recovered sequences could belong to invertebrate prey, rotifer inquilines, pollinators and other animals possibly living inside the pitchers. however, we found no directional trend or site-based differences in motu richness with elevational gradient. use of molecular techniques for dietary or contents analysis is a powerful way to examine numerous degraded samples, although factors such as dna persistence and the relationship with species presence still have to be completely determined.",2019
"315",NA,"seasonally varying marine influences on the coastal ecosystem detected through molecular gut analysis","terrestrial predators on marine shores benefit from the inflow of organisms and matter from the marine ecosystem, often causing very high predator densities and indirectly affecting the abundance of other prey species on shores. this indirect effect may be particularly strong if predators shift diets between seasons. we therefore quantified the seasonal variation in diet of two wolf spider species that dominate the shoreline predator community, using molecular gut content analyses with general primers to detect the full prey range. across the season, spider diets changed, with predominantly terrestrial prey from may until july and predominantly marine prey (mainly chironomids) from august until october. this pattern coincided with a change in the spider age and size structure, and prey abundance data and resource selection analyses suggest that the higher consumption of chironomids during autumn is due to an ontogenetic diet shift rather than to variation in prey abundance. the analyses suggested that small dipterans with a weak flight capacity, such as chironomidae, sphaeroceridae, scatopsidae and ephydridae, were overrepresented in the gut of small juvenile spiders during autumn, whereas larger, more robust prey, such as lepidoptera, anthomyidae and dolichopodidae, were overrepresented in the diet of adult spiders during spring. the effect of the inflow may be that the survival and growth of juvenile spiders is higher in areas with high chironomid abundances, leading to higher densities of adult spiders and higher predation rates on the terrestrial prey next spring.",2019

"328",NA,"slippage of degenerate primers can cause variation in amplicon length","it is well understood that homopolymer regions should be avoided for primer binding to prevent off-target amplification. however, in metabarcoding, it is often difficult to avoid primer degeneracy in order to maximize taxa detection. we here investigate primer binding specificity using different primer sets from several invertebrate metabarcoding studies. our results indicate that primers frequently bound 1-2â€‰bp upstream in taxa where a homopolymer region was present in the amplification direction. primer binding 1â€‰bp downstream was observed less frequently. this primer slippage leads to taxon-specific length variation in amplicons and subsequent length variation in recovered sequences. some widely used primer sets were severely affected by this bias, while others were not. while this variation will only have small impacts on the designation of operational taxonomic units (otus) by clustering algorithms that ignore terminal gaps, primer sets employed in metabarcoding projects should be evaluated for their sensitivity to slippage. moreover, steps should be taken to reduce slippage by improving protocols for primer design. for example, the flanking region adjacent to the 3' end of the primer is not considered by current primer development software although gc clamps in this position could mitigate slippage.",2018

"336",NA,"insights into global planktonic diatom diversity the importance of comparisons between phylogenetically equivalent units that account for time","metabarcoding has offered unprecedented insights into microbial diversity. in many studies, short dna sequences are binned into consecutively lower linnaean ranks, and ranked groups (e.g., genera) are the units of biodiversity analyses. these analyses assume that linnaean ranks are biologically meaningful and that identically ranked groups are comparable. we used a metabarcode dataset for marine planktonic diatoms to illustrate the limits of this approach. we found that the 20 most abundant marine planktonic diatom genera ranged in age from 4 to 134 million years, indicating the non-equivalence of genera because some have had more time to diversify than others. however, species richness was largely independent of genus age, suggesting that disparities in species richness among genera were better explained by variation in rates of speciation and extinction. taxonomic classifications often do not reflect phylogeny, so genus-level analyses can include phylogenetically nested genera, further confounding rank-based analyses. these results underscore the indispensable role of phylogeny in understanding patterns of microbial diversity.",2018
"337",NA,"capture enrichment of aquatic environmental dna a first proof of concept","environmental dna (edna) sampling-the detection of genetic material in the environment to infer species presence-has rapidly grown as a tool for sampling aquatic animal communities. a potentially powerful feature of environmental sampling is that all taxa within the habitat shed dna and so may be detectable, creating opportunity for whole-community assessments. however, animal dna in the environment tends to be comparatively rare, making it necessary to enrich for genetic targets from focal taxa prior to sequencing. current metabarcoding approaches for enrichment rely on bulk amplification using conserved primer annealing sites, which can result in skewed relative sequence abundance and failure to detect some taxa because of pcr bias. here, we test capture enrichment via hybridization as an alternative strategy for target enrichment using a series of experiments on environmental samples and laboratory-generated, known-composition dna mixtures. capture enrichment resulted in detecting multiple species in both kinds of samples, and postcapture relative sequence abundance accurately reflected initial relative template abundance. however, further optimization is needed to permit reliable species detection at the very low-dna quantities typical of environmental samples (<0.1â ng dna). we estimate that our capture protocols are comparable to, but less sensitive than, current pcr-based edna analyses.",2018

"339",NA,"stream acidification and reduced aquatic prey availability are associated with dietary shifts in an obligate riparian neotropical migratory songbird","streams and their surrounding riparian habitats are linked by reciprocal exchanges of insect prey essential to both aquatic and terrestrial consumers. aquatic insects comprise a large proportion of total prey in riparian habitats and are opportunistically exploited by terrestrial insectivores; however, several species of songbirds are known to preferentially target aquatic prey via specialized foraging strategies. for these songbirds, reduced availability of aquatic insects via stream acidification may result in compensatory changes in provisioning during the nesting period, thereby influencing both adult and nestling diet composition. in this study, we used dna metabarcoding to test the hypothesis that an obligate riparian neotropical migratory songbird, the louisiana waterthrush (parkesia motacilla), expands its diet to compensate for the loss of preferred aquatic prey taxa (primarily pollution-sensitive ephemeroptera, plecoptera, and trichoptera) as a result of stream acidification. our results revealed that both adult and nestling waterthrush exhibited an increase in dietary richness and niche breadth resulting from the consumption of terrestrial prey taxa in acidified riparian habitats. in contrast, compensatory dietary shifts were not observed in syntopic neotropical migrant species known to primarily provision terrestrial prey taxa. in addition to providing support for our hypothesis that waterthrush compensate for stream acidification and aquatic prey limitations by expanding their diet, our findings highlight the vulnerability of louisiana waterthrush to anthropogenic disturbances that compromise stream quality or reduce the availability of pollution-sensitive aquatic insects.",2018

"351",NA,"the choice of universal primers and the characteristics of the species mixture determine when dna metabarcoding can be quantitative","dna metabarcoding is a technique used to survey biodiversity in many ecological settings, but there are doubts about whether it can provide quantitative results, that is, the proportions of each species in the mixture as opposed to a species list. while there are several experimental studies that report quantitative metabarcoding results, there are a similar number that fail to do so. here, we provide the rationale to understand under what circumstances the technique can be quantitative. in essence, we simulate a mixture of dna of s species with a defined initial abundance distribution. in the simulated pcr, each species increases its concentration following a certain amplification efficiency. the final dna concentration will reflect the initial one when the efficiency is similar for all species; otherwise, the initial and final dna concentrations would be poorly related. although there are many known factors that modulate amplification efficiency, we focused on the number of primer-template mismatches, arguably the most important one. we used 15 common primers pairs targeting the mitochondrial coi region and the mitogenomes of ca. 1,200 insect species. the results showed that some primers pairs produced quantitative results under most circumstances, whereas some other primers failed to do so. in conclusion, depending on the primer pair used in the pcr amplification and on the characteristics of the mixture analysed (i.e., high species richness, low evenness), dna metabarcoding can provide a quantitative estimate of the relative abundances of different species.",2019

"356",NA,"boosting dna metabarcoding for biomonitoring with phylogenetic estimation of operational taxonomic units ecological profiles","dna metabarcoding has been introduced as a revolutionary way to identify organisms and monitor ecosystems. however, the potential of this approach for biomonitoring remains partially unfulfilled because a significant part of the sampled dna cannot be affiliated to species due to incomplete reference libraries. thus, biotic indices, which are based on the estimated abundances of species in a community and their ecological profiles, can be inaccurate. we propose to compute biotic indices using phylogenetic imputation of operational taxonomic units (otus') ecological profiles (otu-piti approach). first, otus sequences are inserted within a reference phylogeny. second, otus' ecological profiles are estimated on the basis of their phylogenetic relationships with reference species whose ecology is known. based on these ecological profiles, biotic indices can be computed using all available otus. using freshwater diatoms as a case study, we show that short dna barcodes can be placed accurately within a phylogeny and their ecological preferences estimated with a satisfactory level of precision. in the light of these results, we tested the approach with a data set of 139 environmental samples of benthic river diatoms for which the same biotic index (specific sensitivity index) was calculated using (a) traditional microscopy, (b) otus with taxonomic assignment approach, (c) otus with phylogenetic estimation of ecological profiles (otu-piti) and (d) otu with taxonomic assignment completed by the phylogenetic approach (otu-piti) for unclassified otus. using traditional microscopy as a reference, we found that the combination of the otus' taxonomic assignment completed by the phylogenetic method performed satisfactorily and substantially better than the other methods tested.",2018

"398",NA,"limited dietary overlap amongst resident arctic herbivores in winter complementary insights from complementary methods","snow may prevent arctic herbivores from accessing their forage in winter, forcing them to aggregate in the few patches with limited snow. in high arctic greenland, arctic hare and rock ptarmigan often forage in muskox feeding craters. we therefore hypothesized that due to limited availability of forage, the dietary niches of these resident herbivores overlap considerably, and that the overlap increases as winter progresses. to test this, we analyzed fecal samples collected in early and late winter. we used molecular analysis to identify the plant taxa consumed, and stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen to quantify the dietary niche breadth and dietary overlap. the plant taxa found indicated only limited dietary differentiation between the herbivores. as expected, dietary niches exhibited a strong contraction from early to late winter, especially for rock ptarmigan. this may indicate increasing reliance on particular plant resources as winter progresses. in early winter, the diet of rock ptarmigan overlapped slightly with that of muskox and arctic hare. contrary to our expectations, no inter-specific dietary niche overlap was observed in late winter. this overall pattern was specifically revealed by combined analysis of molecular data and stable isotope contents. hence, despite foraging in the same areas and generally feeding on the same plant taxa, the quantitative dietary overlap between the three herbivores was limited. this may be attributable to species-specific consumption rates of plant taxa. yet, arctic hare and rock ptarmigan may benefit from muskox opening up the snow pack, thereby allowing them to access the plants.",2018
"399",NA,"bacterial communities of diatoms display strong conservation across strains and time","interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria play important roles in shaping the microenvironment surrounding these organisms and in turn influence global biogeochemical cycles. this microenvironment, known as the phycosphere, is presumed to shape the bacterial diversity around phytoplankton and thus stimulate a diverse array of interactions between both groups. although many studies have attempted to characterize bacterial communities that associate and interact with phytoplankton, bias in bacterial cultivation and consistency and persistence of bacterial communities across phytoplankton isolates likely impede the understanding of these microbial associations. here, we isolate four strains of the diatom asterionellopsis glacialis and three strains of the diatom nitzschia longissima and show through metabarcoding of the bacterial 16s rdna gene that though each species possesses a unique bacterial community, the bacterial composition across strains from the same species are highly conserved at the genus level. cultivation of all seven strains in the laboratory for longer than 1 year resulted in only small changes to the bacterial composition, suggesting that despite strong pressures from laboratory culturing conditions associations between these diatoms and their bacterial communities are robust. specific operational taxonomic units (otus) belonging to the roseobacter-clade appear to be conserved across all strains and time, suggesting their importance to diatoms. in addition, we isolate a range of cultivable bacteria from one of these cultures, a. glacialis strain a3, including several strains of shimia marina and nautella sp. that appear closely related to otus conserved across all strains and times. coculturing of a3 with some of its cultivable bacteria as well as other diatom-associated bacteria shows a wide range of responses that include enhancing diatom growth. cumulatively, these findings suggest that phytoplankton possess unique microbiomes that are consistent across strains and temporal scales.",2018
"400",NA,"using dna metabarcoding for simultaneous inference of common vampire bat diet and population structure","metabarcoding diet analysis has become a valuable tool in animal ecology; however, co-amplified predator sequences are not generally used for anything other than to validate predator identity. exemplified by the common vampire bat, we demonstrate the use of metabarcoding to infer predator population structure alongside diet assessments. growing populations of common vampire bats impact human, livestock and wildlife health in latin america through transmission of pathogens, such as lethal rabies viruses. techniques to determine large-scale variation in vampire bat diet and bat population structure would empower locality- and species-specific projections of disease transmission risks. however, previously used methods are not cost-effective and efficient for large-scale applications. using bloodmeal and faecal samples from common vampire bats from coastal, andean and amazonian regions of peru, we showcase metabarcoding as a scalable tool to assess vampire bat population structure and feeding preferences. dietary metabarcoding was highly effective, detecting vertebrate prey in 93.2% of the samples. bats predominantly preyed on domestic animals, but fed on tapirs at one amazonian site. in addition, we identified arthropods in 9.3% of samples, likely reflecting consumption of ectoparasites. using the same data, we document mitochondrial geographic population structure in the common vampire bat in peru. such simultaneous inference of vampire bat diet and population structure can enable new insights into the interplay between vampire bat ecology and disease transmission risks. importantly, the methodology can be incorporated into metabarcoding diet studies of other animals to couple information on diet and population structure.",2018
"401",NA,"sequence clustering threshold has little effect on the recovery of microbial community structure","analysis of microbial community structure by multivariate ordination methods, using data obtained by high-throughput sequencing of amplified markers (i.e., dna metabarcoding), often requires clustering of dna sequences into operational taxonomic units (otus). parameters for the clustering procedure tend not to be justified but are set by tradition rather than being based on explicit knowledge. in this study, we explore the extent to which ordination results are affected by variation in parameter settings for the clustering procedure. amplicon sequence data from nine microbial community studies, representing different sampling designs, spatial scales and ecosystems, were subjected to clustering into otus at seven different similarity thresholds (clustering thresholds) ranging from 87% to 99% sequence similarity. the 63 data sets thus obtained were subjected to parallel dca and gnmds ordinations. the resulting community structures were highly similar across all clustering thresholds. we explain this pattern by the existence of strong ecological structuring gradients and phylogenetically diverse sets of abundant otus that are highly stable across clustering thresholds. removing low-abundance, rare otus had negligible effects on community patterns. our results indicate that microbial data sets with a clear gradient structure are highly robust to choice of sequence clustering threshold.",2018

"403",NA,"performance of amplicon and shotgun sequencing for accurate biomass estimation in invertebrate community samples","new applications of dna and rna sequencing are expanding the field of biodiversity discovery and ecological monitoring, yet questions remain regarding precision and efficiency. due to primer bias, the ability of metabarcoding to accurately depict biomass of different taxa from bulk communities remains unclear, while pcr-free whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequencing may provide a more reliable alternative. here, we used a set of documented mock communities comprising 13 species of freshwater macroinvertebrates of estimated individual biomass, to compare the detection efficiency of coi metabarcoding (three different amplicons) and shotgun mitogenome sequencing. additionally, we used individual coi barcoding and de novo mitochondrial genome sequencing, to provide reference sequences for otu assignment and metagenome mapping (mitogenome skimming), respectively. we found that, even though both methods occasionally failed to recover very low abundance species, metabarcoding was less consistent, by failing to recover some species with higher abundances, probably due to primer bias. shotgun sequencing results provided highly significant correlations between read number and biomass in all but one species. conversely, the read-biomass relationships obtained from metabarcoding varied across amplicons. specifically, we found significant relationships for eight of 13 (amplicons b1fr-450â bp, ff130r-130â bp) or four of 13 (amplicon fffr, 658â bp) species. combining the results of all three coi amplicons (multiamplicon approach) improved the read-biomass correlations for some of the species. overall, mitogenomic sequencing yielded more informative predictions of biomass content from bulk macroinvertebrate communities than metabarcoding. however, for large-scale ecological studies, metabarcoding currently remains the most commonly used approach for diversity assessment.",2018

"412",NA,"revealing hidden insect fungus interactions moderately specialized modular and anti nested detritivore networks","ecological networks are composed of interacting communities that influence ecosystem structure and function. fungi are the driving force for ecosystem processes such as decomposition and carbon sequestration in terrestrial habitats, and are strongly influenced by interactions with invertebrates. yet, interactions in detritivore communities have rarely been considered from a network perspective. in the present study, we analyse the interaction networks between three functional guilds of fungi and insects sampled from dead wood. using dna metabarcoding to identify fungi, we reveal a diversity of interactions differing in specificity in the detritivore networks, involving three guilds of fungi. plant pathogenic fungi were relatively unspecialized in their interactions with insects inhabiting dead wood, while interactions between the insects and wood-decay fungi exhibited the highest degree of specialization, which was similar to estimates for animal-mediated seed dispersal networks in previous studies. the low degree of specialization for insect symbiont fungi was unexpected. in general, the pooled insect-fungus networks were significantly more specialized, more modular and less nested than randomized networks. thus, the detritivore networks had an unusual anti-nested structure. future studies might corroborate whether this is a common aspect of networks based on interactions with fungi, possibly owing to their often intense competition for substrate.",2018
"413",NA,"dna metabarcoding of nestling feces reveals provisioning of aquatic prey and resource partitioning among neotropical migratory songbirds in a riparian habitat","riparian habitats are characterized by substantial flows of emergent aquatic insects that cross the stream-forest interface and provide an important source of prey for insectivorous birds. the increased availability of prey arising from aquatic subsidies attracts high densities of neotropical migratory songbirds that are thought to exploit emergent aquatic insects as a nestling food resource; however, the prey preferences and diets of birds in these communities are only broadly understood. in this study, we utilized dna metabarcoding to investigate the extent to which three syntopic species of migratory songbirds-acadian flycatcher, louisiana waterthrush, and wood thrush-breeding in appalachian riparian habitats (pennsylvania, usa) exploit and partition aquatic prey subsidies as a nestling food resource. despite substantial differences in adult foraging strategies, nearly every nestling in this study consumed aquatic taxa, suggesting that aquatic subsidies are an important prey resource for neotropical migrants nesting in riparian habitats. while our results revealed significant interspecific dietary niche divergence, the diets of acadian flycatcher and wood thrush nestlings were strikingly similar and exhibited significantly more overlap than expected. these results suggest that the dietary niches of neotropical migrants with divergent foraging strategies may converge due to the opportunistic provisioning of non-limiting prey resources in riparian habitats. in addition to providing the first application of dna metabarcoding to investigate diet in a community of neotropical migrants, this study emphasizes the importance of aquatic subsidies in supporting breeding songbirds and improves our understanding of how anthropogenic disturbances to riparian habitats may negatively impact long-term avian conservation.",2018
"414",NA,"mycobiome of cysts of the soybean cyst nematode under long term crop rotation","the soybean cyst nematode (scn), heterodera glycines ichinohe (phylum nematoda), is a major pathogen of soybean. it causes substantial yield losses worldwide and is difficult to control because the cyst protects the eggs which can remain viable for nearly a decade. crop rotation with non-host crops and use of biocontrol organisms such as fungi and bacteria offer promising approaches, but remain hampered by lack of knowledge of the biology of nematode parasitic organisms. we used a high-throughput metabarcoding approach to characterize fungal communities associated with the scn cyst, a microenvironment in soil that may harbor both nematode parasites and plant pathogens. scn cysts were collected from a long-term crop rotation experiment in southeastern minnesota at three time points over two growing seasons to characterize diversity of fungi inhabiting cysts and to examine how crop rotation and seasonal variation affects fungal communities. a majority of fungi in cysts belonged to ascomycota and basidiomycota, but the presence of several early diverging fungal subphyla thought to be primarily plant and litter associated, including mortierellomycotina and glomeromycotina (e.g., arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi), suggests a possible role as nematode egg parasites. species richness varied by both crop rotation and season and was higher in early years of crop rotation and in fall at the end of the growing season. crop rotation and season also impacted fungal community composition and identified several classes of fungi, including eurotiomycetes, sordariomycetes, and orbiliomycetes (e.g., nematode trapping fungi), with higher relative abundance in early soybean rotations. the relative abundance of several genera was correlated with increasing years of soybean. fungal communities also varied by season and were most divergent at midseason. the percentage of otus assigned to mortierellomycotina_cls_incertae_sedis and sordariomycetes increased at midseason, while orbiliomycetes decreased at midseason, and glomeromycetes increased in fall. ecological guilds of fungi containing an animal-pathogen lifestyle, as well as potential egg-parasitic taxa previously isolated from parasitized scn eggs, increased at midseason. the animal pathogen guilds included known (e.g., pochonia chlamydosporia) and new candidate biocontrol organisms. this research advances knowledge of the ecology of nematophagous fungi in agroecosystems and their use as biocontrol agents of the scn.",2018
"415",NA,"acidification increases abundances of vibrionales and planctomycetia associated to a seaweed grazer system potential consequences for disease and prey digestion efficiency","ocean acidification significantly affects marine organisms in several ways, with complex interactions. seaweeds might benefit from rising co2 through increased photosynthesis and carbon acquisition, with subsequent higher growth rates. however, changes in seaweed chemistry due to increased co2 may change the nutritional quality of tissue for grazers. in addition, organisms live in close association with a diverse microbiota, which can also be influenced by environmental changes, with feedback effects. as gut microbiomes are often linked to diet, changes in seaweed characteristics and associated microbiome can affect the gut microbiome of the grazer, with possible fitness consequences. in this study, we experimentally investigated the effects of acidification on the microbiome of the invasive brown seaweed sargassum muticum and a native isopod consumer synisoma nadejda. both were exposed to ambient co2 conditions (380 ppm, ph 8.16) and an acidification treatment (1,000 ppm, ph 7.86) for three weeks. microbiome diversity and composition were determined using high-throughput sequencing of the variable regions v5-7 of 16s rrna. we anticipated that as a result of acidification, the seaweed-associated bacterial community would change, leading to further changes in the gut microbiome of grazers. however, no significant effects of elevated co2 on the overall bacterial community structure and composition were revealed in the seaweed. in contrast, significant changes were observed in the bacterial community of the grazer gut. although the bacterial community of s. muticum as whole did not change, oceanospirillales and vibrionales (mainly pseudoalteromonas) significantly increased their abundance in acidified conditions. the former, which uses organic matter compounds as its main source, may have opportunistically taken advantage of the possible increase of the c/n ratio in the seaweed under acidified conditions. pseudoalteromonas, commonly associated to diseased seaweeds, suggesting that acidification may facilitate opportunistic/pathogenic bacteria. in the gut of s. nadejda, the bacterial genus planctomycetia increased abundance under elevated co2. this shift might be associated to changes in food (s. muticum) quality under acidification. planctomycetia are slow-acting decomposers of algal polymers that could be providing the isopod with an elevated algal digestion and availability of inorganic compounds to compensate the shifted c/n ratio under acidification in their food. in conclusion, our results indicate that even after only three weeks of acidified conditions, bacterial communities associated to ungrazed seaweed and to an isopod grazer show specific, differential shifts in associated bacterial community. these have potential consequences for seaweed health (as shown in corals) and isopod food digestion. the observed changes in the gut microbiome of the grazer seem to reflect changes in the seaweed chemistry rather than its microbial composition.",2018

"418",NA,"implementation options for dna based identification into ecological status assessment under the european water framework directive","assessment of ecological status for the european water framework directive (wfd) is based on ""biological quality elements"" (bqes), namely phytoplankton, benthic flora, benthic invertebrates and fish. morphological identification of these organisms is a time-consuming and expensive procedure. here, we assess the options for complementing and, perhaps, replacing morphological identification with procedures using edna, metabarcoding or similar approaches. we rate the applicability of dna-based identification for the individual bqes and water categories (rivers, lakes, transitional and coastal waters) against eleven criteria, summarised under the headlines representativeness (for example suitability of current sampling methods for dna-based identification, errors from dna-based species detection), sensitivity (for example capability to detect sensitive taxa, unassigned reads), precision of dna-based identification (knowledge about uncertainty), comparability with conventional approaches (for example sensitivity of metrics to differences in dna-based identification), cost effectiveness and environmental impact. overall, suitability of dna-based identification is particularly high for fish, as edna is a well-suited sampling approach which can replace expensive and potentially harmful methods such as gill-netting, trawling or electrofishing. furthermore, there are attempts to replace absolute by relative abundance in metric calculations. for invertebrates and phytobenthos, the main challenges include the modification of indices and completing barcode libraries. for phytoplankton, the barcode libraries are even more problematic, due to the high taxonomic diversity in plankton samples. if current assessment concepts are kept, dna-based identification is least appropriate for macrophytes (rivers, lakes) and angiosperms/macroalgae (transitional and coastal waters), which are surveyed rather than sampled. we discuss general implications of implementing dna-based identification into standard ecological assessment, in particular considering any adaptations to the wfd that may be required to facilitate the transition to molecular data.",2018
"419",NA,"nematode associated microbial taxa do not correlate with host phylogeny geographic region or feeding morphology in marine sediment habitats","studies of host-associated microbes are critical for advancing our understanding of ecology and evolution across diverse taxa and ecosystems. nematode worms are ubiquitous across most habitats on earth, yet little is known about host-associated microbial assemblages within the phylum. free-living nematodes are globally abundant and diverse in marine sediments, with species exhibiting distinct buccal cavity (mouth) morphologies that are thought to play an important role in feeding ecology and life history strategies. here, we investigated patterns in marine nematode microbiomes, by characterizing host-associated microbial taxa in 281 worms isolated from a range of habitat types (deep-sea, shallow water, methane seeps, lophelia coral mounds, kelp holdfasts) across three distinct geographic regions (arctic, southern california and gulf of mexico). microbiome profiles were generated from single worms spanning 33 distinct morphological genera, using a two-gene metabarcoding approach to amplify the v4 region of the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene targeting bacteria/archaea and the v1-v2 region of the 18s rrna gene targeting microbial eukaryotes. contrary to our expectations, nematode microbiome profiles demonstrated no distinct patterns either globally (across depths and ocean basins) or locally (within site); prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial assemblages did not correlate with nematode feeding morphology, host phylogeny or morphological identity, ocean region or marine habitat type. however, fine-scale analysis of nematode microbiomes revealed a variety of novel ecological interactions, including putative parasites and symbionts, and potential associations with bacterial/archaeal taxa involved in nitrogen and methane cycling. our results suggest that in marine habitats, free-living nematodes may utilize diverse and generalist foraging strategies that are not correlated with host genotype or feeding morphology. furthermore, some abiotic factors such as geographic region and habitat type do not appear to play an obvious role in structuring host-microbe associations or feeding preferences.",2018

"441",NA,"assessing performance of spore samplers in monitoring aeromycobiota and fungal plant pathogen diversity in canada","spore samplers are widely used in pathogen surveillance but not so much for monitoring the composition of aeromycobiota. in canada, a nationwide spore-sampling network (aeronet) was established as a pilot project to assess fungal community composition in air and rain samples collected using three different spore samplers in the summers of 2010 and 2011. metabarcodes of the internal transcribed spacer (its) were exhaustively characterized for three of the network sites, in british columbia (bc), quã©bec (qc), and prince edward island (pei), to compare performance of the samplers. sampler type accounted for ca. 20% of the total explainable variance in aeromycobiota compositional heterogeneity, with air samplers recovering more ascomycota and rain samplers recovering more basidiomycota. spore samplers showed different abilities to collect 27 fungal genera that are plant pathogens. for instance, cladosporium spp., drechslera spp., and entyloma spp. were collected mainly by air samplers, while fusarium spp., microdochium spp., and ustilago spp. were recovered more frequently with rain samplers. the diversity and abundance of some fungi were significantly affected by sampling location and time (e.g., alternaria and bipolaris) and weather conditions (e.g., mycocentrospora and leptosphaeria), and depended on using its1 or its2 as the barcoding region (e.g., epicoccum and botrytis). the observation that canada's aeromycobiota diversity correlates with cooler, wetter conditions and northward wind requires support from more long-term data sets. our vision of the aeronet network, combined with high-throughput sequencing (hts) and well-designed sampling strategies, may contribute significantly to a national biovigilance network for protecting plants of agricultural and economic importance in canada.importance the current study compared the performance of spore samplers for collecting broad-spectrum air- and rain-borne fungal pathogens using a metabarcoding approach. the results provided a thorough characterization of the aeromycobiota in the coastal regions of canada in relation to the influence of climatic factors. this study lays the methodological basis to eventually develop knowledge-based guidance on pest surveillance by assisting in the selection of appropriate spore samplers.",2018

"446",NA,"recolonizing gray wolves increase parasite infection risk in their prey","the recent recolonization of central europe by the european gray wolf (canis lupus) provides an opportunity to study the dynamics of parasite transmission for cases when a definitive host returns after a phase of local extinction. we investigated whether a newly established wolf population increased the prevalence of those parasites in ungulate intermediate hosts representing wolf prey, whether some parasite species are particularly well adapted to wolves, and the potential basis for such adaptations. we recorded sarcocystis species richness in wolves and sarcocystis prevalence in ungulates harvested in study sites with and without permanent wolf presence in germany using microscopy and dna metabarcoding. sarcocystis prevalence in red deer (cervus elaphus) was significantly higher in wolf areas (79.7%) than in control areas (26.3%) but not in roe deer (capreolus capreolus) (97.2% vs. 90.4%) or wild boar (sus scrofa) (82.8% vs. 64.9%). of 11 sarcocystis species, sarcocystis taeniata and sarcocystis grueneri occurred more often in wolves than expected from the sarcocystis infection patterns of ungulate prey. both sarcocystis species showed a higher increase in prevalence in ungulates in wolf areas than other sarcocystis species, suggesting that they are particularly well adapted to wolves, and are examples of ""wolf specialists"". sarcocystis species richness in wolves was significantly higher in pups than in adults. ""wolf specialists"" persisted during wolf maturation. the results of this study demonstrate that (1) predator-prey interactions influence parasite prevalence, if both predator and prey are part of the parasite life cycle, (2) mesopredators do not necessarily replace the apex predator in parasite transmission dynamics for particular parasites of which the apex predator is the definitive host, even if meso- and apex predators were from the same taxonomic family (here: canidae, e.g., red foxes vulpes vulpes), and (3) age-dependent immune maturation contributes to the control of protozoan infection in wolves.",2018

"464",NA,"mosquito vector associated microbiota metabarcoding bacteria and eukaryotic symbionts across habitat types in thailand endemic for dengue and other arthropod borne diseases","vector-borne diseases are a major health burden, yet factors affecting their spread are only partially understood. for example, microbial symbionts can impact mosquito reproduction, survival, and vectorial capacity, and hence affect disease transmission. nonetheless, current knowledge of mosquito-associated microbial communities is limited. to characterize the bacterial and eukaryotic microbial communities of multiple vector species collected from different habitat types in disease endemic areas, we employed next-generation 454 pyrosequencing of 16s and 18s rrna amplicon libraries, also known as metabarcoding. we investigated pooled whole adult mosquitoes of three medically important vectors, aedes aegypti, ae.â albopictus, and culex quinquefasciatus, collected from different habitats across central thailand where we previously characterized mosquito diversity. our results indicate that diversity within the mosquito microbiota is low, with the majority of microbes assigned to one or a few taxa. two of the most common eukaryotic and bacterial genera recovered (ascogregarina and wolbachia, respectively) are known mosquito endosymbionts with potentially parasitic and long evolutionary relationships with their hosts. patterns of microbial composition and diversity appeared to differ by both vector species and habitat for a given species, although high variability between samples suggests a strong stochastic element to microbiota assembly. in general, our findings suggest that multiple factors, such as habitat condition and mosquito species identity, may influence overall microbial community composition, and thus provide a basis for further investigations into the interactions between vectors, their microbial communities, and human-impacted landscapes that may ultimately affect vector-borne disease risk.",2018
"465",NA,"species delimitation for the molecular taxonomy and ecology of the widely distributed microbial eukaryote genus euplotes alveolata ciliophora","recent advances in high-throughput sequencing and metabarcoding technologies are revolutionizing our understanding of the diversity and ecology of microbial eukaryotes (protists). the interpretation of protist diversity and the elucidation of their ecosystem function are, however, impeded by problems with species delimitation, especially as it applies to molecular taxonomy. here, using the ciliate euplotes as an example, we describe approaches for species delimitation based on integrative taxonomy by using evolutionary and ecological perspectives and selecting the most appropriate metabarcoding gene markers as proxies for species units. our analyses show that: euplotes (sensu lato) comprises six distinct clades, mainly as result of ecological speciation; the validity of the genera euplotes (sensu stricto), euplotoides, euplotopsis and moneuplotes are not supported; the vannus-type group, which includes species without distinct morphological differences, seems to be undergoing incipient speciation and contains cryptic species; the hypervariable v4 region of the small subunit rdna and d1-d2 region of the large subunit rdna are the promising candidates for general species delimitation in euplotes.",2018
"466",NA,"feeding immunity physiological and behavioral responses to infection and resource limitation","resources are a core currency of species interactions and ecology in general (e.g., think of food webs or competition). within parasite-infected hosts, resources are divided among the competing demands of host immunity and growth as well as parasite reproduction and growth. effects of resources on immune responses are increasingly understood at the cellular level (e.g., metabolic predictors of effector function), but there has been limited consideration of how these effects scale up to affect individual energetic regimes (e.g., allocation trade-offs), susceptibility to infection, and feeding behavior (e.g., responses to local resource quality and quantity). we experimentally rewilded laboratory mice (strain c57bl/6) in semi-natural enclosures to investigate the effects of dietary protein and gastrointestinal nematode (trichuris muris) infection on individual-level immunity, activity, and behavior. the scale and realism of this field experiment, as well as the multiple physiological assays developed for laboratory mice, enabled us to detect costs, trade-offs, and potential compensatory mechanisms that mice employ to battle infection under different resource conditions. we found that mice on a low-protein diet spent more time feeding, which led to higher body fat stores (i.e., concentration of a satiety hormone, leptin) and altered metabolite profiles, but which did not fully compensate for the effects of poor nutrition on albumin or immune defenses. specifically, immune defenses measured as interleukin 13 (il13) (a primary cytokine coordinating defense against t. muris) and as t. muris-specific igg1 titers were lower in mice on the low-protein diet. however, these reduced defenses did not result in higher worm counts in mice with poorer diets. the lab mice, living outside for the first time in thousands of generations, also consumed at least 26 wild plant species occurring in the enclosures, and dna metabarcoding revealed that the consumption of different wild foods may be associated with differences in leptin concentrations. when individual foraging behavior was accounted for, worm infection significantly reduced rates of host weight gain. housing laboratory mice in outdoor enclosures provided new insights into the resource costs of immune defense to helminth infection and how hosts modify their behavior to compensate for those costs.",2017
"467",NA,"extreme rainfall affects assembly of the root associated fungal community","global warming is resulting in increased frequency of weather extremes. root-associated fungi play important roles in terrestrial biogeochemical cycling processes, but the way in which they are affected by extreme weather is unclear. here, we performed long-term field monitoring of the root-associated fungus community of a short rotation coppice willow plantation, and compared community dynamics before and after a once in 100â yr rainfall event that occurred in the uk in 2012. monitoring of the root-associated fungi was performed over a 3-yr period by metabarcoding the fungal internal transcribed spacer (its) region. repeated soil testing and continuous climatic monitoring supplemented community data, and the relative effects of environmental and temporal variation were determined on the root-associated fungal community. soil saturation and surface water were recorded throughout the early growing season of 2012, following extreme rainfall. this was associated with a crash in the richness and relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi, with each declining by over 50%. richness and relative abundance of saprophytes and pathogens increased. we conclude that extreme rainfall events may be important yet overlooked determinants of root-associated fungal community assembly. given the integral role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in biogeochemical cycles, these events may have considerable impacts upon the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems.",2018
"468",NA,"metatranscriptome analysis reveals environmental and diel regulation of a heterosigma akashiwo raphidophyceae bloom","despite numerous laboratory studies on physiologies of harmful algal bloom (hab) species, physiologies of these algae during a natural bloom are understudied. here, we investigated a bloom of the raphidophyte heterosigma akashiwo in the east china sea in 2014 using metabarcode (18s rdna) and metatranscriptome sequencing. based on 18s rdna analyses, the phytoplankton community shifted from high diversity in the pre-bloom stage to h. akashiwo predominance during the bloom. a sharp decrease in ambient dissolved inorganic phosphate and strong up-regulation of phosphate and dissolved organic phosphorus (dop) uptake genes, including the rarely documented (ppgpp)ase, in h. akashiwo from pre-bloom to bloom was indicative of rapid phosphorus uptake and efficient utilization of dop that might be a driver of the h. akashiwo bloom. furthermore, observed up-regulated expression of mixotrophy-related genes suggests potential contribution of mixotrophy to the bloom. accelerating photosynthetic carbon fixation was also implied by the up-regulation of carbonic anhydrase genes during the bloom. notably, we also observed a strong morning-to-afternoon shift in the expression of many genes. our findings provide insights into metabolic processes likely important for h. akashiwo bloom formation, and suggest the need to consider timing of sampling in field studies on this alga.",2018
"469",NA,"is there a link between aging and microbiome diversity in exceptional mammalian longevity","a changing microbiome has been linked to biological aging in mice and humans, suggesting a possible role of gut flora in pathogenic aging phenotypes. many bat species have exceptional longevity given their body size and some can live up to ten times longer than expected with little signs of aging. this study explores the anal microbiome of the exceptionally long-lived myotis myotis bat, investigating bacterial composition in both adult and juvenile bats to determine if the microbiome changes with age in a wild, long-lived non-model organism, using non-lethal sampling. the anal microbiome was sequenced using metabarcoding in more than 50 individuals, finding no significant difference between the composition of juvenile and adult bats, suggesting that age-related microbial shifts previously observed in other mammals may not be present in myotis myotis. functional gene categories, inferred from metabarcoding data, expressed in the m. myotis microbiome were categorized identifying pathways involved in metabolism, dna repair and oxidative phosphorylation. we highlight an abundance of 'proteobacteria' relative to other mammals, with similar patterns compared to other bat microbiomes. our results suggest that m. myotis may have a relatively stable, unchanging microbiome playing a role in their extended 'health spans' with the advancement of age, and suggest a potential link between microbiome and sustained, powered flight.",2018
"470",NA,"blow flies as urban wildlife sensors","wildlife detection in urban areas is very challenging. conventional monitoring techniques such as direct observation are faced with the limitation that urban wildlife is extremely elusive. it was recently shown that invertebrate-derived dna (idna) can be used to assess wildlife diversity in tropical rainforests. flies, which are ubiquitous and very abundant in most cities, may also be used to detect wildlife in urban areas. in urban ecosystems, however, overwhelming quantities of domestic mammal dna could completely mask the presence of wild mammal dna. to test whether urban wild mammals can be detected using fly idna, we performed dna metabarcoding of pools of flies captured in berlin, germany, using three combinations of blocking primers. our results show that domestic animal sequences are, as expected, very dominant in urban environments. nevertheless, wild mammal sequences can often be retrieved, although they usually only represent a minor fraction of the sequence reads. fly idna metabarcoding is therefore a viable approach for quick scans of urban wildlife diversity. interestingly, our study also shows that blocking primers can interact with each other in ways that affect the outcome of metabarcoding. we conclude that the use of complex combinations of blocking primers, although potentially powerful, should be carefully planned when designing experiments.",2018
"471",NA,"assessing the utility of metabarcoding for diet analyses of the omnivorous wild pig sus scrofa","wild pigs (sus scrofa) are an invasive species descended from both domestic swine and eurasian wild boar that was introduced to north america during the early 1500s. wild pigs have since become the most abundant free-ranging exotic ungulate in the united states. large and ever-increasing populations of wild pigs negatively impact agriculture, sport hunting, and native ecosystems with costs estimated to exceed $1.5â billion/year within the united states. wild pigs are recognized as generalist feeders, able to exploit a broad array of locally available food resources, yet their feeding behaviors remain poorly understood as partially digested material is often unidentifiable through traditional stomach content analyses. to overcome the limitation of stomach content analyses, we developed a dna sequencing-based protocol to describe the plant and animal diet composition of wild pigs. additionally, we developed and evaluated blocking primers to reduce the amplification and sequencing of host dna, thus providing greater returns of sequences from diet items. we demonstrate that the use of blocking primers produces significantly more sequencing reads per sample from diet items, which increases the robustness of ascertaining animal diet composition with molecular tools. further, we show that the overall plant and animal diet composition is significantly different between the three areas sampled, demonstrating this approach is suitable for describing differences in diet composition among the locations.",2018
"472",NA,"sorting specimen rich invertebrate samples with cost effective ngs barcodes validating a reverse workflow for specimen processing","biologists frequently sort specimen-rich samples to species. this process is daunting when based on morphology, and disadvantageous if performed using molecular methods that destroy vouchers (e.g., metabarcoding). an alternative is barcoding every specimen in a bulk sample and then presorting the specimens using dna barcodes, thus mitigating downstream morphological work on presorted units. such a ""reverse workflow"" is too expensive using sanger sequencing, but we here demonstrate that is feasible with an next-generation sequencing (ngs) barcoding pipeline that allows for cost-effective high-throughput generation of short specimen-specific barcodes (313â bp of coi; laboratory cost <$0.50 per specimen) through next-generation sequencing of tagged amplicons. we applied our approach to a large sample of tropical ants, obtaining barcodes for 3,290 of 4,032 specimens (82%). ngs barcodes and their corresponding specimens were then sorted into molecular operational taxonomic units (motus) based on objective clustering and automated barcode gap discovery (abgd). high diversity of 88-90 motus (4% clustering) was found and morphologically validated based on preserved vouchers. the motus were overwhelmingly in agreement with morphospecies (match ratio 0.95 at 4% clustering). because of lack of coverage in existing barcode databases, only 18 could be accurately identified to named species, but our study yielded new barcodes for 48 species, including 28 that are potentially new to science. with its low cost and technical simplicity, the ngs barcoding pipeline can be implemented by a large range of laboratories. it accelerates invertebrate species discovery, facilitates downstream taxonomic work, helps with building comprehensive barcode databases and yields precise abundance information.",2018
"473",NA,"exploring the cultivable ectocarpus microbiome","coastal areas form the major habitat of brown macroalgae, photosynthetic multicellular eukaryotes that have great ecological value and industrial potential. macroalgal growth, development, and physiology are influenced by the microbial community they accommodate. studying the algal microbiome should thus increase our fundamental understanding of algal biology and may help to improve culturing efforts. currently, a freshwater strain of the brown macroalga ectocarpus subulatus is being developed as a model organism for brown macroalgal physiology and algal microbiome studies. it can grow in high and low salinities depending on which microbes it hosts. however, the molecular mechanisms involved in this process are still unclear. cultivation of ectocarpus-associated bacteria is the first step toward the development of a model system for in vitro functional studies of brown macroalgal-bacterial interactions during abiotic stress. the main aim of the present study is thus to provide an extensive collection of cultivable e. subulatus-associated bacteria. to meet the variety of metabolic demands of ectocarpus-associated bacteria, several isolation techniques were applied, i.e., direct plating and dilution-to-extinction cultivation techniques, each with chemically defined and undefined bacterial growth media. algal tissue and algal growth media were directly used as inoculum, or they were pretreated with antibiotics, by filtration, or by digestion of algal cell walls. in total, 388 isolates were identified falling into 33 genera (46 distinct strains), of which halomonas (gammaproteobacteria), bosea (alphaproteobacteria), and limnobacter (betaproteobacteria) were the most abundant. comparisons with 16s rrna gene metabarcoding data showed that culturability in this study was remarkably high (âˆ¼50%), although several cultivable strains were not detected or only present in extremely low abundance in the libraries. these undetected bacteria could be considered as part of the rare biosphere and they may form the basis for the temporal changes in the ectocarpus microbiome.",2017
"474",NA,"the effect of dna degradation bias in passive sampling devices on metabarcoding studies of arthropod communities and their associated microbiota","pcr amplification bias is a well-known problem in metagenomic analysis of arthropod communities. in contrast, variation of dna degradation rates is a largely neglected source of bias. differential degradation of dna molecules could cause underrepresentation of taxa in a community sequencing sample. arthropods are often collected by passive sampling devices, like malaise traps. specimens in such a trap are exposed to varying periods of suboptimal storage and possibly different rates of dna degradation. degradation bias could thus be a significant issue, skewing diversity estimates. here, we estimate the effect of differential dna degradation on the recovery of community diversity of hawaiian arthropods and their associated microbiota. we use a simple dna size selection protocol to test for degradation bias in mock communities, as well as passively collected samples from actual malaise traps. we compare the effect of dna degradation to that of varying pcr conditions, including primer choice, annealing temperature and cycle number. our results show that dna degradation does indeed bias community analyses. however, the effect of this bias is of minor importance compared to that induced by changes in pcr conditions. analyses of the macro and microbiome from passively collected arthropod samples are thus well worth pursuing.",2018

"477",NA,"agriculture shapes the trophic niche of a bat preying on multiple pest arthropods across europe evidence from dna metabarcoding","the interaction between agricultural production and wildlife can shape, and even condition, the functioning of both systems. in this study, we i) explored the degree to which a widespread european bat, namely the common bent-wing bat miniopterus schreibersii, consumes crop-damaging insects at a continental scale, and ii) tested whether its dietary niche is shaped by the extension and type of agricultural fields. we employed a dual-primer dna metabarcoding approach to characterize arthropod 16s and coi dna sequences within bat faecal pellets collected across 16 southern european localities, to first characterize the bat species' dietary niche, second measure the incidence of agricultural pests across their ranges and third assess whether geographical dietary variation responds to climatic, landscape diversity, agriculture type and vegetation productivity factors. we detected 12 arthropod orders, among which lepidopterans were predominant. we identified >200 species, 44 of which are known to cause agricultural damage. pest species were detected at all but one sampling site and in 94% of the analysed samples. furthermore, the dietary diversity of m. schreibersii exhibited a negative linear relation with the area of intensive agricultural fields, thus suggesting crops restrict the dietary niche of bats to prey taxa associated with agricultural production within their foraging range. overall, our results imply that m. schreibersii might be a valuable asset for biological pest suppression in a variety of agricultural productions and highlight the dynamic interplay between wildlife and agricultural systems.",2018
"478",NA,"its2 metabarcoding analysis complements lichen mycobiome diversity data","lichen thalli harbor complex fungal communities (mycobiomes) of species with divergent trophic and ecological strategies. the complexity and diversity of lichen mycobiomes are still largely unknown, despite surveys combining culture-based methods and high-throughput sequencing (hts). the results of such surveys are strongly influenced by the barcode locus chosen, its sensitivity in discriminating taxa, and the depth to which public sequence repositories cover the phylogenetic spectrum of fungi. here, we use hts of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (its2) to assess the taxonomic composition and diversity of a well-characterized, alpine rock lichen community that includes thalli symptomatically infected by lichenicolous fungi as well as asymptomatic thalli. taxa belonging to the order chaetothyriales are the major components of the observed lichen mycobiomes. we predict sequences representative of lichenicolous fungi characterized morphologically and assess their asymptomatic presence in lichen thalli. we demonstrated the limitations of metabarcoding in fungi and show how the estimation of species diversity widely differs when its1 or its2 are used as barcode, and particularly biases the detection of basidiomycota. the complementary analysis of both its1 and its2 loci is therefore required to reliably estimate the diversity of lichen mycobiomes.",2018
"479",NA,"metabarcoding for the parallel identification of several hundred predators and their prey application to bat species diet analysis","assessing diet variability is of main importance to better understand the biology of bats and design conservation strategies. although the advent of metabarcoding has facilitated such analyses, this approach does not come without challenges. biases may occur throughout the whole experiment, from fieldwork to biostatistics, resulting in the detection of false negatives, false positives or low taxonomic resolution. we detail a rigorous metabarcoding approach based on a short coi minibarcode and two-step pcr protocol enabling the ""all at once"" taxonomic identification of bats and their arthropod prey for several hundreds of samples. our study includes faecal pellets collected in france from 357 bats representing 16 species, as well as insect mock communities that mimic bat meals of known composition, negative and positive controls. all samples were analysed using three replicates. we compare the efficiency of dna extraction methods, and we evaluate the effectiveness of our protocol using identification success, taxonomic resolution, sensitivity and amplification biases. our parallel identification strategy of predators and prey reduces the risk of mis-assigning prey to wrong predators and decreases the number of molecular steps. controls and replicates enable to filter the data and limit the risk of false positives, hence guaranteeing high confidence results for both prey occurrence and bat species identification. we validate 551 coi variants from arthropod including 18 orders, 117 family, 282 genus and 290 species. our method therefore provides a rapid, resolutive and cost-effective screening tool for addressing evolutionary ecological issues or developing ""chirosurveillance"" and conservation strategies.",2018
"480",NA,"quantitative species level ecology of reef fish larvae via metabarcoding","the larval pool of coral reef fish has a crucial role in the dynamics of adult fish populations. however, large-scale species-level monitoring of species-rich larval pools has been technically impractical. here, we use high-throughput metabarcoding to study larval ecology in the gulf of aqaba, a region that is inhabited by >500 reef fish species. we analysed 9,933 larvae from 383 samples that were stratified over sites, depth and time. metagenomic dna extracted from pooled larvae was matched to a mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i barcode database compiled for 77% of known fish species within this region. this yielded species-level reconstruction of the larval community, allowing robust estimation of larval spatio-temporal distributions. we found significant correlations between species abundance in the larval pool and in local adult assemblages, suggesting a major role for larval supply in determining local adult densities. we documented larval flux of species whose adults were never documented in the region, suggesting environmental filtering as the reason for the absence of these species. larvae of several deep-sea fishes were found in shallow waters, supporting their dispersal over shallow bathymetries, potentially allowing lessepsian migration into the mediterranean sea. our method is applicable to any larval community and could assist coral reef conservation and fishery management efforts.",2018
"481",NA,"estimating and mitigating amplification bias in qualitative and quantitative arthropod metabarcoding","amplicon based metabarcoding promises rapid and cost-efficient analyses of species composition. however, it is disputed whether abundance estimates can be derived from metabarcoding due to taxon specific pcr amplification biases. pcr-free approaches have been suggested to mitigate this problem, but come with considerable increases in workload and cost. here, we analyze multilocus datasets of diverse arthropod communities, to evaluate whether amplification bias can be countered by (1) targeting loci with highly degenerate primers or conserved priming sites, (2) increasing pcr template concentration, (3) reducing pcr cycle number or (4) avoiding locus specific amplification by directly sequencing genomic dna. amplification bias is reduced considerably by degenerate primers or targeting amplicons with conserved priming sites. surprisingly, a reduction of pcr cycles did not have a strong effect on amplification bias. the association of taxon abundance and read count was actually less predictable with fewer cycles. even a complete exclusion of locus specific amplification did not exclude bias. copy number variation of the target loci may be another explanation for read abundance differences between taxa, which would affect amplicon based and pcr free methods alike. as read abundance biases are taxon specific and predictable, the application of correction factors allows abundance estimates.",2017

"536",NA,"taxonomy assignment approach determines the efficiency of identification of otus in marine nematodes","precision and reliability of barcode-based biodiversity assessment can be affected at several steps during acquisition and analysis of data. identification of operational taxonomic units (otus) is one of the crucial steps in the process and can be accomplished using several different approaches, namely, alignment-based, probabilistic, tree-based and phylogeny-based. the number of identified sequences in the reference databases affects the precision of identification. this paper compares the identification of marine nematode otus using alignment-based, tree-based and phylogeny-based approaches. because the nematode reference dataset is limited in its taxonomic scope, otus can only be assigned to higher taxonomic categories, families. the phylogeny-based approach using the evolutionary placement algorithm provided the largest number of positively assigned otus and was least affected by erroneous sequences and limitations of reference data, compared to alignment-based and tree-based approaches.",2017
"537",NA,"an expanded mammal mitogenome dataset from southeast asia","southeast (se) asia is 1 of the most biodiverse regions in the world, and it holds approximately 20% of all mammal species. despite this, the majority of se asia's genetic diversity is still poorly characterized. the growing interest in using environmental dna to assess and monitor se asian species, in particular threatened mammals-has created the urgent need to expand the available reference database of mitochondrial barcode and complete mitogenome sequences. we have partially addressed this need by generating 72 new mitogenome sequences reconstructed from dna isolated from a range of historical and modern tissue samples. approximately 55 gigabases of raw sequence were generated. from this data, we assembled 72 complete mitogenome sequences, with an average depth of coverage of ã—102.9 and ã—55.2 for modern samples and historical samples, respectively. this dataset represents 52 species, of which 30 species had no previous mitogenome data available. the mitogenomes were geotagged to their sampling location, where known, to display a detailed geographical distribution of the species. our new database of 52 taxa will strongly enhance the utility of environmental dna approaches for monitoring mammals in se asia as it greatly increases the likelihoods that identification of metabarcoding sequencing reads can be assigned to reference sequences. this magnifies the confidence in species detections and thus allows more robust surveys and monitoring programmes of se asia's threatened mammal biodiversity. the extensive collections of historical samples from se asia in western and se asian museums should serve as additional valuable material to further enrich this reference database.",2017

"540",NA,"honey bee foraging ecology season but not landscape diversity shapes the amount and diversity of collected pollen","the availability of pollen in agricultural landscapes is essential for the successful growth and reproduction of honey bee colonies (apis mellifera l.). the quantity and diversity of collected pollen can influence the growth and health of honey bee colonies, but little is known about the influence of landscape structure on pollen diet. in a field experiment, we rotated 16 honey bee colonies across 16 agricultural landscapes, used traps to collect samples of collected pollen and observed intra-colonial dance communication to gain information about foraging distances. dna metabarcoding was applied to analyze mixed pollen samples. neither the amount of collected pollen nor pollen diversity was related to landscape diversity. however, we found a strong seasonal variation in the amount and diversity of collected pollen in all sites independent of landscape diversity. the observed increase in foraging distances with decreasing landscape diversity suggests that honey bees compensated for lower landscape diversity by increasing their pollen foraging range in order to maintain pollen amount and diversity. our results underscore the importance of a diverse pollen diet for honey bee colonies. agri-environmental schemes aiming to support pollinators should focus on possible spatial and temporal gaps in pollen availability and diversity in agricultural landscapes.",2017
"541",NA,"spatiotemporal variation and networks in the mycobiome of the wheat canopy","the phyllosphere is an important habitat for a diverse microbiome and an important entry point for many pathogens. factors that shape the phyllosphere microbiome and also the co-existence among members and how they affect disease development are largely understudied. in this study we examined the wheat mycobiome by using metabarcoding of the fungal its1 region. leaf samples were taken from four cultivars grown at two locations in denmark. samples were taken from the three uppermost leaves and at three growth stages to better understand spatiotemporal variation of the mycobiome. analysis of read abundances showed that geographical location had a major effect in shaping the mycobiome in the total dataset, but also leaf position, growth stage and cultivar were important drivers of fungal communities. cultivar was most important in explaining variation in older leaves whereas location better explained the variation in younger leaves, suggesting that communities are shaped over time by the leaf environment. network analysis revealed negative co-existence between zymoseptoria tritici and the yeasts sporobolomyces, dioszegia, and cystofilobasidiaceae. the relative abundance of z. tritici and the yeasts was relatively constant between individual samples, suggesting that fast growing fungi rapidly occupy empty space in the phyllosphere.",2017
"542",NA,"differences in temperature and water chemistry shape distinct diversity patterns in thermophilic microbial communities","this report describes the biodiversity and ecology of microbial mats developed in thermal gradients (20 to 65â°c) in the surroundings of three drillings (chiraleu [ch], ciocaia [ci], and mihai bravu [mb]) tapping a hyperthermal aquifer in romania. using a metabarcoding approach, 16s rrna genes were sequenced from both dna and rna transcripts (cdna) and compared. the relationships between the microbial diversity and the physicochemical factors were explored. additionally, the cdna data were used for in silico functionality predictions, bringing new insights into the functional potential and dynamics of these communities. the results showed that each hot spring determined the formation of distinct microbial communities. in the ch mats (40 to 53â°c), the abundance of cyanobacteria decreased with temperature, opposite to those of chloroflexi and proteobacteriaectothiorhodospira, oscillatoria, and methanogenic archaea dominated the ci communities (20 to 65â°c), while the mb microbial mats (53 to 65â°c) were mainly composed of chloroflexi, hydrogenophilus, thermi, and aquificae alpha-diversity was negatively correlated with the increase in water temperature, while beta-diversity was shaped in each hot spring by the unique combination of physicochemical parameters, regardless of the type of nucleic acid analyzed (dna versus cdna). the rank correlation analysis revealed a unique model that associated environmental data with community composition, consisting in the combined effect of na+, k+, hco3-, and po43- concentrations, together with temperature and electrical conductivity. these factors seem to determine the grouping of samples according to location, rather than with the similarities in thermal regimes, showing that other parameters beside temperature are significant drivers of biodiversity.importance hot spring microbial mats represent a remarkable manifestation of life on earth and have been intensively studied for decades. moreover, as hot spring areas are isolated and have a limited exchange of organisms, nutrients, and energy with the surrounding environments, hot spring microbial communities can be used in model studies to elucidate the colonizing potential within extreme settings. thus, they are of great importance in evolutionary biology, microbial ecology, and exobiology. in spite of all the efforts that have been made, the current understanding of the influence of temperature and water chemistry on the microbial community composition, diversity, and abundance in microbial mats is limited. in this study, the composition and diversity of microbial communities developed in thermal gradients in the vicinity of three hot springs from romania were investigated, each having particular physicochemical characteristics. our results expose new factors that could determine the formation of these ecosystems, expanding the current knowledge in this regard.",2017
"543",NA,"parasites dominate hyperdiverse soil protist communities in neotropical rainforests","high animal and plant richness in tropical rainforest communities has long intrigued naturalists. it is unknown if similar hyperdiversity patterns are reflected at the microbial scale with unicellular eukaryotes (protists). here we show, using environmental metabarcoding of soil samples and a phylogeny-aware cleaning step, that protist communities in neotropical rainforests are hyperdiverse and dominated by the parasitic apicomplexa, which infect arthropods and other animals. these host-specific parasites potentially contribute to the high animal diversity in the forests by reducing population growth in a density-dependent manner. by contrast, too few operational taxonomic units (otus) of oomycota were found to broadly drive high tropical tree diversity in a host-specific manner under the janzen-connell model. extremely high otu diversity and high heterogeneity between samples within the same forests suggest that protists, not arthropods, are the most diverse eukaryotes in tropical rainforests. our data show that protists play a large role in tropical terrestrial ecosystems long viewed as being dominated by macroorganisms.",2017
"544",NA,"yeasts dominate soil fungal communities in three lowland neotropical rainforests","forest soils typically harbour a vast diversity of fungi, but are usually dominated by filamentous (hyphae-forming) taxa. compared to temperate and boreal forests, though, we have limited knowledge about the fungal diversity in tropical rainforest soils. here we show, by environmental metabarcoding of soil samples collected in three neotropical rainforests, that yeasts dominate the fungal communities in terms of the number of sequencing reads and otus. these unicellular forms are commonly found in aquatic environments, and their hyperdiversity may be the result of frequent inundation combined with numerous aquatic microenvironments in these rainforests. other fungi that are frequent in aquatic environments, such as the abundant chytridiomycotina, were also detected. while there was low similarity in otu composition within and between the three rainforests, the fungal communities in central america were more similar to each other than the communities in south america, reflecting a general biogeographic pattern also seen in animals, plants and protists.",2017
"545",NA,"pearl millet genetic traits shape rhizobacterial diversity and modulate rhizosphere aggregation","root exudation contributes to soil carbon allocation and also to microbial c and energy supply, which subsequently impacts soil aggregation around roots. biologically-driven soil structural formation is an important driver of soil fertility. plant genetic determinants of exudation and more generally of factors promoting rhizosphere soil aggregation are largely unknown. here, we characterized rhizosphere aggregation in a panel of 86 pearl millet inbred lines using a ratio of root-adhering soil dry mass per root tissue dry mass (ras/rt). this ratio showed significant variations between lines, with a roughly 2-fold amplitude between lowest and highest average values. for 9 lines with contrasting aggregation properties, we then compared the bacterial diversity and composition in root-adhering soil. bacterial î±-diversity metrics increased with the ""ras/rt ratio."" regarding taxonomic composition, the rhizobiales were stimulated in lines showing high aggregation level whereas bacillales were more abundant in lines with low ratio. 184 strains of cultivable exopolysaccharides-producing bacteria have been isolated from the rhizosphere of some lines, including members from rhizobiales and bacillales. however, at this stage, we could not find a correlation between abundance of eps-producing species in bacterial communities and the ratio ras/rt. these results illustrated the impact of cereals genetic trait variation on soil physical properties and microbial diversity. this opens the possibility of considering plant breeding to help management of soil carbon content and physical characteristics through carbon rhizodeposition in soil.",2017
"546",NA,"the use of nemabiome metabarcoding to explore gastro intestinal nematode species diversity and anthelmintic treatment effectiveness in beef calves","next-generation deep amplicon sequencing, or metabarcoding, has revolutionized the study of microbial communities in humans, animals and the environment. however, such approaches have yet to be applied to parasitic helminth communities. we recently described the first example of such a method - nemabiome sequencing - based on deep-amplicon sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 (its-2) rdna, and validated its ability to quantitatively assess the species composition of cattle gastro-intestinal nematode (gin) communities. here, we present the first application of this approach to explore gin species diversity and the impact of anthelmintic drug treatments. first, we investigated gin species diversity in cow-calf beef cattle herds in several different regions, using coproculture derived l3s. a screen of 50 canadian beef herds revealed parasite species diversity to be low overall. the majority of parasite communities were comprised of just two species; ostertagia ostertagi and cooperia oncophora. cooperia punctata was present at much lower levels overall, but nevertheless comprised a substantive part of the parasite community of several herds in eastern canada. in contrast, nemabiome sequencing revealed higher gin species diversity in beef calves sampled from central/south-eastern usa and sao paulo state, brazil. in these regions c. punctata predominated in most herds with haemonchus placei predominating in a few cases. ostertagia ostertagi and c. oncophora were relatively minor species in these regions in contrast to the canadian herds. we also examined the impact of routine macrocyclic lactone pour-on treatments on gin communities in the canadian beef herds. low treatment effectiveness was observed in many cases, and nemabiome sequencing revealed an overall increase in the proportion of cooperia spp. relative to o. ostertagi post-treatment. this work demonstrates the power of nemabiome metabarcoding to provide a detailed picture of gin parasite community structure in large sample sets and illustrates its potential use in research, diagnostics and surveillance.",2017
"547",NA,"vertical gradients in species richness and community composition across the twilight zone in the north pacific subtropical gyre","although metazoan animals in the mesopelagic zone play critical roles in deep pelagic food webs and in the attenuation of carbon in midwaters, the diversity of these assemblages is not fully known. a metabarcoding survey of mesozooplankton diversity across the epipelagic, mesopelagic and upper bathypelagic zones (0-1500â m) in the north pacific subtropical gyre revealed far higher estimates of species richness than expected given prior morphology-based studies in the region (4,024 otus, 10-fold increase), despite conservative bioinformatic processing. operational taxonomic unit (otu) richness of the full assemblage peaked at lower epipelagic-upper mesopelagic depths (100-300â m), with slight shoaling of maximal richness at night due to diel vertical migration, in contrast to expectations of a deep mesopelagic diversity maximum as reported for several plankton groups in early systematic and zoogeographic studies. four distinct depth-stratified species assemblages were identified, with faunal transitions occurring at 100â m, 300â m and 500â m. highest diversity occurred in the smallest zooplankton size fractions (0.2-0.5â mm), which had significantly lower % otus classified due to poor representation in reference databases, suggesting a deep reservoir of poorly understood diversity in the smallest metazoan animals. a diverse meroplankton assemblage also was detected (350 otus), including larvae of both shallow and deep living benthic species. our results provide some of the first insights into the hidden diversity present in zooplankton assemblages in midwaters, and a molecular reappraisal of vertical gradients in species richness, depth distributions and community composition for the full zooplankton assemblage across the epipelagic, mesopelagic and upper bathypelagic zones.",2017

"551",NA,"its1 metabarcoding highlights low specificity of lichen mycobiomes at a local scale","as self-supporting and long-living symbiotic structures, lichens provide a habitat for many other organisms beside the traditionally considered lichen symbionts-the myco- and the photobionts. the lichen-inhabiting fungi either develop diagnostic phenotypes or occur asymptomatically. because the degree of specificity towards the lichen host is poorly known, we studied the diversity of these fungi among neighbouring lichens on rocks in an alpine habitat. using a sequencing metabarcoding approach, we show that lichen mycobiomes clearly reflect the overlap of multiple ecological sets of taxa, which differ in their trophic association with lichen thalli. the lack of specificity to the lichen mycobiome is further supported by the lack of community structure observed using clustering and ordination methods. the communities encountered across samples largely result from the subsampling of a shared species pool, in which we identify three major ecological components: (i) a generalist environmental pool, (ii) a lichenicolous/endolichenic pool and (iii) a pool of transient species. these taxa majorly belong to the fungal classes dothideomycetes, eurotiomycetes and tremellomycetes with close relatives in adjacent ecological niches. we found no significant evidence that the phenotypically recognized lichenicolous fungi influence the occurrence of the other asymptomatic fungi in the host thalli. we claim that lichens work as suboptimal habitats or as a complex spore and mycelium bank, which modulate and allow the regeneration of local fungal communities. by performing an approach that minimizes ambiguities in the taxonomic assignments of fungi, we present how lichen mycobiomes are also suitable targets for improving bioinformatic analyses of fungal metabarcoding.",2017

"558",NA,"influence of host plant on thaumetopoea pityocampa gut bacterial community","microbial communities associated to the gut of insects are attracting an increasing interest, mainly because of their role in influencing several host life-traits. the characterization of the gut microbial community is pivotal for understanding insect ecology and, thus, to develop novel pest management strategies. the pine processionary moth, thaumetopoea pytiocampa (denis & schiff.) (lepidoptera: thaumetopoeidae), is a severe defoliator of pine forests, able to feed on several pine species. in this work, we performed a metabarcoding analysis to investigate, for the first time, the diversity of the gut bacterial community of pine processionary larvae associated with three different host pine species (pinus halepensis, pinus nigra subsp. laricio, and pinus pinaster). we found that the gut microbial community of t. pityocampa larvae collected on p. halapensis was different from that associated with larvae collected from p. nigra and p. pinaster. moreover, the high presence of bacteria belonging to the genera modestobacter, delftia, and unidentified methylobacteriaceae retrieved in larvae feeding on p. halapensis suggested that specific interactions can occur. our results provide the evidence that different host plant differently impact on the microbiota diversity of t. pityocampa larvae, contributing to the general knowledge of this pest with information that could be useful in shaping the next generation of pest control strategies.",2018
"559",NA,"high occurrence of jellyfish predation by black browed and campbell albatross identified by dna metabarcoding","gelatinous zooplankton are a large component of the animal biomass in all marine environments, but are considered to be uncommon in the diet of most marine top predators. however, the diets of key predator groups like seabirds have conventionally been assessed from stomach content analyses, which cannot detect most gelatinous prey. as marine top predators are used to identify changes in the overall species composition of marine ecosystems, such biases in dietary assessment may impact our detection of important ecosystem regime shifts. we investigated albatross diet using dna metabarcoding of scats to assess the prevalence of gelatinous zooplankton consumption by two albatross species, one of which is used as an indicator species for ecosystem monitoring. black-browed and campbell albatross scats were collected from eight breeding colonies covering the circumpolar range of these birds over two consecutive breeding seasons. fish was the main dietary item at most sites; however, cnidarian dna, primarily from scyphozoan jellyfish, was present in 42% of samples overall and up to 80% of samples at some sites. jellyfish was detected during all breeding stages and consumed by adults and chicks. trawl fishery catches of jellyfish near the falkland islands indicate a similar frequency of jellyfish occurrence in albatross diets in years of high and low jellyfish availability, suggesting jellyfish consumption may be selective rather than opportunistic. warmer oceans and overfishing of finfish are predicted to favour jellyfish population increases, and we demonstrate here that dietary dna metabarcoding enables measurements of the contribution of gelatinous zooplankton to the diet of marine predators.",2017

"562",NA,"historical biome distribution and recent human disturbance shape the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi","the availability of global microbial diversity data, collected using standardized metabarcoding techniques, makes microorganisms promising models for investigating the role of regional and local factors in driving biodiversity. here we modelled the global diversity of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (am) fungi using currently available data on am fungal molecular diversity (small subunit (ssu) ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequences) in field samples. to differentiate between regional and local effects, we estimated species pools (sets of potentially suitable taxa) for each site, which are expected to reflect regional processes. we then calculated community completeness, an index showing the fraction of the species pool present, which is expected to reflect local processes. we found significant spatial variation, globally in species pool size, as well as in local and dark diversity (absent members of the species pool). species pool size was larger close to areas containing tropical grasslands during the last glacial maximum, which are possible centres of diversification. community completeness was greater in regions of high wilderness (remoteness from human disturbance). local diversity was correlated with wilderness and current connectivity to mountain grasslands. applying the species pool concept to symbiotic fungi facilitated a better understanding of how biodiversity can be jointly shaped by large-scale historical processes and recent human disturbance.",2017
"563",NA,"taxa area relationship of aquatic fungi on deciduous leaves","one of the fundamental patterns in macroecology is the increase in the number of observed taxa with size of sampled area. for microbes, the shape of this relationship remains less clear. the current study assessed the diversity of aquatic fungi, by the traditional approach based on conidial morphology (captures reproducing aquatic hyphomycetes) and next generation sequencing (ngs; captures other fungi as well), on graded sizes of alder leaves (0.6 to 13.6 cm2). leaves were submerged in two streams in geographically distant locations: the oliveira stream in portugal and the boss brook in canada. decay rates of alder leaves and fungal sporulation rates did not differ between streams. fungal biomass was higher in boss brook than in oliveira stream, and in both streams almost 100% of the reads belonged to active fungal taxa. in general, larger leaf areas tended to harbour more fungi, but these findings were not consistent between techniques. morphospecies-based diversity increased with leaf area in boss brook, but not in oliveira stream; metabarcoding data showed an opposite trend. the higher resolution of metabarcoding resulted in steeper taxa-accumulation curves than morphospecies-based assessments (fungal conidia morphology). fungal communities assessed by metabarcoding were spatially structured by leaf area in both streams. metabarcoding promises greater resolution to assess biodiversity patterns in aquatic fungi and may be more accurate for assessing taxa-area relationships and local to global diversity ratios.",2017

"569",NA,"temporal dynamics of soil microbial communities below the seedbed under two contrasting tillage regimes","agricultural productivity relies on a wide range of ecosystem services provided by the soil biota. plowing is a fundamental component of conventional farming, but long-term detrimental effects such as soil erosion and loss of soil organic matter have been recognized. moving towards more sustainable management practices such as reduced tillage or crop residue retention can reduce these detrimental effects, but will also influence structure and function of the soil microbiota with direct consequences for the associated ecosystem services. although there is increasing evidence that different tillage regimes alter the soil microbiome, we have a limited understanding of the temporal dynamics of these effects. here, we used high-throughput sequencing of bacterial and fungal ribosomal markers to explore changes in soil microbial community structure under two contrasting tillage regimes (conventional and reduced tillage) either with or without crop residue retention. soil samples were collected over the growing season of two crops (vicia faba and triticum aestivum) below the seedbed (15-20 cm). tillage, crop and growing stage were significant determinants of microbial community structure, but the impact of tillage showed only moderate temporal dependency. whereas the tillage effect on soil bacteria showed some temporal dependency and became less strong at later growing stages, the tillage effect on soil fungi was more consistent over time. crop residue retention had only a minor influence on the community. six years after the conversion from conventional to reduced tillage, soil moisture contents and nutrient levels were significantly lower under reduced than under conventional tillage. these changes in edaphic properties were related to specific shifts in microbial community structure. notably, bacterial groups featuring copiotrophic lifestyles or potentially carrying the ability to degrade more recalcitrant compounds were favored under conventional tillage, whereas taxa featuring more oligotrophic lifestyles were more abundant under reduced tillage. our study found that, under the specific edaphic and climatic context of central belgium, different tillage regimes created different ecological niches that select for different microbial lifestyles with potential consequences for the ecosystem services provided to the plants and their environment.",2017

"606",NA,"the nuclear 28s gene fragment d3 as species marker in oribatid mites acari oribatida from german peatlands","to make oribatid mites an applicable tool in monitoring programs it is necessary to find a molecular species marker that allows distinct, rapid and easy species identification. in previous studies, the common barcoding sequence coi showed to be too variable to serve as species marker in oribatid mites. the aim of the present study is to evaluate the potential use of the d3 region of the nuclear 28s rdna gene for species identification. therefore, we generated a reference dna library of 28s d3 to identify specimens of the oribatida from germany, with focus on species occurring in peatlands being one of the most endangered habitats in europe. new dna sequences were obtained from 325 individuals and 64 species (58 genera, 34 families). by adding 28s d3-sequences from genbank we altogether analysed 385 sequences from 89 german species, 32 of them restricted to peatlands and further 42 occurring in peatlands occasionally, representing 46 and 33% of the oribatids in german peatlands, respectively. p-distances were measured between species within families as well as for intraspecific divergence. 28s d3 showed low intraspecific genetic p-distances between 0 and 0.5%, interspecific distances within families varied between 0 and 9.7%. most species pairs within families were further separated by one to four indels in addition to substitutions. altogether, 93% of all analysed species are clearly delineated by 28s d3. our study emphasises that 28s d3 rdna is a useful barcode for the identification of oribatid mite specimens and represents an important step in building-up a comprehensive barcode library to allow metabarcoding analyses of environmental peatland samples for oribatida in germany as well as in central europe.",2017
"607",NA,"culture independent analysis using gnd as a target gene to assess escherichia coli diversity and community structure","current culture methods to investigate changes in escherichia coli community structure are often slow and laborious. genes such as gnd (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) have a highly variable nucleotide sequence and may provide a target for e. coli microbiome analysis using culture-independent methods. metabarcoded pcr primers were used to generate separate libraries from calf faecal samples for high throughput sequencing. although a total of 348 separate gnd sequence types (gsts) were identified, 188 were likely to be due to sequencing errors. of the remaining 160 gsts, 92 did not match those in a database of 319 separate gnd sequences. 'animal' was the main determinant of e. coli diversity with limited impact of sample type or dna extraction method on intra-host e. coli community variation from faeces and recto-anal mucosal swab samples. this culture-independent study has addressed the difficulties of quantifying bacterial intra-species diversity and revealed that, whilst individual animals may harbour >50 separate e. coli strains, communities are dominated by <10 strains alongside a large pool of subdominant strains present at low abundances. this method will be useful for characterising the diversity and population structure of e. coli in experimental studies designed to assess the impact of interventions on the gut microbiome.",2017

"622",NA,"taxonomy free molecular diatom index for high throughput edna biomonitoring","current biodiversity assessment and biomonitoring are largely based on the morphological identification of selected bioindicator taxa. recently, several attempts have been made to use edna metabarcoding as an alternative tool. however, until now, most applied metabarcoding studies have been based on the taxonomic assignment of sequences that provides reference to morphospecies ecology. usually, only a small portion of metabarcoding data can be used due to a limited reference database and a lack of phylogenetic resolution. here, we investigate the possibility to overcome these limitations using a taxonomy-free approach that allows the computing of a molecular index directly from edna data without any reference to morphotaxonomy. as a case study, we use the benthic diatoms index, commonly used for monitoring the biological quality of rivers and streams. we analysed 87 epilithic samples from swiss rivers, the ecological status of which was established based on the microscopic identification of diatom species. we compared the diatom index derived from edna data obtained with or without taxonomic assignment. our taxonomy-free approach yields promising results by providing a correct assessment for 77% of examined sites. the main advantage of this method is that almost 95% of otus could be used for index calculation, compared to 35% in the case of the taxonomic assignment approach. its main limitations are under-sampling and the need to calibrate the index based on the microscopic assessment of diatoms communities. however, once calibrated, the taxonomy-free molecular index can be easily standardized and applied in routine biomonitoring, as a complementary tool allowing fast and cost-effective assessment of the biological quality of watercourses.",2017

"663",NA,"marine invasions enter the genomic era three lessons from the past and the way forward","the expanding scale and increasing rate of marine biological invasions have been documented since the early 20th century. besides their global ecological and economic impacts, non-indigenous species (nis) also have attracted much attention as opportunities to explore important eco-evolutionary processes such as rapid adaptation, long-distance dispersal and range expansion, and secondary contacts between divergent evolutionary lineages. in this context, genetic tools have been extensively used in the past 20 years. three important issues appear to have emerged from such studies. first, the study of nis has revealed unexpected cryptic diversity in what had previously been assumed homogeneous entities. second, there has been surprisingly little evidence of strong founder events accompanying marine introductions, a pattern possibly driven by large propagule loads. third, the evolutionary processes leading to successful invasion have been difficult to ascertain due to faint genetic signals. here we explore the potential of novel tools associated with high-throughput sequencing (hts) to address these still pressing issues. dramatic increase in the number of loci accessible via hts has the potential to radically increase the power of analyses aimed at species delineation, exploring the population genomic consequences of range expansions, and examining evolutionary processes such as admixture, introgression, and adaptation. nevertheless, the value of this new wealth of genomic data will ultimately depend on the ability to couple it with expanded ""traditional"" efforts, including exhaustive sampling of marine populations over large geographic scales, integrated taxonomic analyses, and population level exploration of quantitative trait differentiation through common-garden and other laboratory experiments.",2016
"664",NA,"biofouling of ultrafiltration membrane by dairy fluids characterization of pioneer colonizer bacteria using a dna metabarcoding approach","biofouling of filtration membranes is a major quality and performance issue for the dairy industry. because biofilms that survive cleaning cycles become resistant over time, prevention strategies limiting the adhesion of bacteria to membranes should be prioritized for sustainable control of biofouling. however, this cannot be achieved because the pioneer bacteria colonizing these membranes are still unknown. consequently, the objective of this study was to characterize pioneer bacteria on the filtration membrane surface and to measure the effect of filtration operational parameters on their diversity. thus, milk and cheese whey were filtered for 5 h in concentration mode at 10 and 40â°c using a laboratory-scale crossflow filtration system equipped with flat-sheet ultrafiltration membranes. pioneer colonizer bacteria found on membranes after a chlorinated alkaline cleaning cycle were identified using a metabarcoding approach targeting the 16s ribosomal rna genes. our results suggested that prevention strategies targeting biofouling should consider the nature of the filtered fluid and the feed temperature (36.15 and 5.09% of the variances observed on membranes, respectively), as well as the microbial environment of the dairy processing plant. in the future, it is hypothesized that cleaning prevention strategies will be specific to each dairy processor and their operational parameters.",2017

"668",NA,"environmental dna from seawater samples correlate with trawl catches of subarctic deepwater fishes","remote polar and deepwater fish faunas are under pressure from ongoing climate change and increasing fishing effort. however, these fish communities are difficult to monitor for logistic and financial reasons. currently, monitoring of marine fishes largely relies on invasive techniques such as bottom trawling, and on official reporting of global catches, which can be unreliable. thus, there is need for alternative and non-invasive techniques for qualitative and quantitative oceanic fish surveys. here we report environmental dna (edna) metabarcoding of seawater samples from continental slope depths in southwest greenland. we collected seawater samples at depths of 188-918 m and compared seawater edna to catch data from trawling. we used illumina sequencing of pcr products to demonstrate that edna reads show equivalence to fishing catch data obtained from trawling. twenty-six families were found with both trawling and edna, while three families were found only with edna and two families were found only with trawling. key commercial fish species for greenland were the most abundant species in both edna reads and biomass catch, and interpolation of edna abundances between sampling sites showed good correspondence with catch sizes. environmental dna sequence reads from the fish assemblages correlated with biomass and abundance data obtained from trawling. interestingly, the greenland shark (somniosus microcephalus) showed high abundance of edna reads despite only a single specimen being caught, demonstrating the relevance of the edna approach for large species that can probably avoid bottom trawls in most cases. quantitative detection of marine fish using edna remains to be tested further to ascertain whether this technique is able to yield credible results for routine application in fisheries. nevertheless, our study demonstrates that edna reads can be used as a qualitative and quantitative proxy for marine fish assemblages in deepwater oceanic habitats. this relates directly to applied fisheries as well as to monitoring effects of ongoing climate change on marine biodiversity-especially in polar ecosystems.",2016
"669",NA,"metabarcoding of fecal samples to determine herbivore diets a case study of the endangered pacific pocket mouse","understanding the diet of an endangered species illuminates the animal's ecology, habitat requirements, and conservation needs. however, direct observation of diet can be difficult, particularly for small, nocturnal animals such as the pacific pocket mouse (heteromyidae: perognathus longimembris pacificus). very little is known of the dietary habits of this federally endangered rodent, hindering management and restoration efforts. we used a metabarcoding approach to identify source plants in fecal samples (n = 52) from the three remaining populations known. the internal transcribed spacers (its) of the nuclear ribosomal loci were sequenced following the illumina miseq amplicon strategy and processed reads were mapped to reference databases. we evaluated a range of threshold mapping criteria and found the best-performing setting generally recovered two distinct mock communities in proportions similar to expectation. we tested our method on captive animals fed a known diet and recovered almost all plant sources, but found substantial heterogeneity among fecal pellets collected from the same individual at the same time. observed richness did not increase with pooling of pellets from the same individual. in field-collected samples, we identified 4-14 plant genera in individual samples and 74 genera overall, but over 50 percent of reads mapped to just six species in five genera. we simulated the effects of sequencing error, variable read length, and chimera formation to infer taxon-specific rates of misassignment for the local flora, which were generally low with some exceptions. richness at the species and genus levels did not reach a clear asymptote, suggesting that diet breadth remained underestimated in the current pool of samples. large numbers of scat samples are therefore needed to make inferences about diet and resource selection in future studies of the pacific pocket mouse. we conclude that our minimally invasive method is promising for determining herbivore diets given a library of sequences from local plants.",2016

"683",NA,"genetic signatures of ecological diversity along an urbanization gradient","despite decades of work in environmental science and ecology, estimating human influences on ecosystems remains challenging. this is partly due to complex chains of causation among ecosystem elements, exacerbated by the difficulty of collecting biological data at sufficient spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales. here, we demonstrate the utility of environmental dna (edna) for quantifying associations between human land use and changes in an adjacent ecosystem. we analyze metazoan edna sequences from water sampled in nearshore marine eelgrass communities and assess the relationship between these ecological communities and the degree of urbanization in the surrounding watershed. counter to conventional wisdom, we find strongly increasing richness and decreasing beta diversity with greater urbanization, and similar trends in the diversity of life histories with urbanization. we also find evidence that urbanization influences nearshore communities at local (hundreds of meters) rather than regional (tens of km) scales. given that different survey methods sample different components of an ecosystem, we then discuss the advantages of edna-which we use here to detect hundreds of taxa simultaneously-as a complement to traditional ecological sampling, particularly in the context of broad ecological assessments where exhaustive manual sampling is impractical. genetic data are a powerful means of uncovering human-ecosystem interactions that might otherwise remain hidden; nevertheless, no sampling method reveals the whole of a biological community.

"684",NA,"detection of invasive mosquito vectors using environmental dna edna from water samples","repeated introductions and spread of invasive mosquito species (ims) have been recorded on a large scale these last decades worldwide. in this context, members of the mosquito genus aedes can present serious risks to public health as they have or may develop vector competence for various viral diseases. while the tiger mosquito (aedes albopictus) is a well-known vector for e.g. dengue and chikungunya viruses, the asian bush mosquito (ae. j. japonicus) and ae. koreicus have shown vector competence in the field and the laboratory for a number of viruses including dengue, west nile fever and japanese encephalitis. early detection and identification is therefore crucial for successful eradication or control strategies. traditional specific identification and monitoring of different and/or cryptic life stages of the invasive aedes species based on morphological grounds may lead to misidentifications, and are problematic when extensive surveillance is needed. in this study, we developed, tested and applied an environmental dna (edna) approach for the detection of three ims, based on water samples collected in the field in several european countries. we compared real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) assays specific for these three species and an edna metabarcoding approach with traditional sampling, and discussed the advantages and limitations of these methods. detection probabilities for edna-based approaches were in most of the specific comparisons higher than for traditional survey and the results were congruent between both molecular methods, confirming the reliability and efficiency of alternative edna-based techniques for the early and unambiguous detection and surveillance of invasive mosquito vectors. the ease of water sampling procedures in the edna approach tested here allows the development of large-scale monitoring and surveillance programs of ims, especially using citizen science projects.

"685",NA,"a quantitative protocol for dna metabarcoding of springtails collembola","we developed a novel protocol with superior quantitative analysis results for dna metabarcoding of collembola, a major soil microarthropod order. degenerate pcr primers were designed for conserved regions in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i (mtcoi) and 16s ribosomal rna (mt16s) genes based on published collembolan mitogenomes. the best primer pair was selected based on its ability to amplify each gene, irrespective of the species. dna was extracted from 10 natural communities sampled in a temperate forest (with typically 25-30 collembolan species per 10 soil samples) and 10 mock communities (with seven cultured collembolan species). the two gene regions were then amplified using the selected primers, ligated with adapters for 454 technology, and sequenced. examination of the natural community samples showed that 32 and 36 operational taxonomic units (defined at a 90% sequence similarity threshold) were recovered from the mtcoi and mt16s data, respectively, which were comparable to the results of the microscopic identification of 25 morphospecies. further, sequence abundances for each collembolan species from the mtcoi and mt16s data of the mock communities, after normalization by using a species as the internal control, showed good correlation with the number of individuals in the samples (r = 0.91-0.99), although relative species abundances within a mock community sample estimated from sequences were skewed from community composition in terms of the number of individuals or biomass of the species. thus, this protocol enables the comparison of collembolan communities in a quantitative manner by metabarcoding.

"686",NA,"first evaluation of foraminiferal metabarcoding for monitoring environmental impact from an offshore oil drilling site","at present, environmental impacts from offshore oil and gas activities are partly determined by measuring changes in macrofauna diversity. morphological identification of macrofauna is time-consuming, expensive and dependent on taxonomic expertise. in this study, we evaluated the applicability of using foraminiferal-specific metabarcoding for routine monitoring. sediment samples were collected along distance gradients from two oil platforms off taranaki (new zealand) and their physico-chemical properties, foraminiferal environmental dna/rna, and macrofaunal composition analyzed. macrofaunal and foraminiferal assemblages showed similar shifts along impact gradients, but responded differently to environmental perturbations. macrofauna were affected by hypoxia, whereas sediment grain size appeared to drive shifts in foraminifera. we identified eight foraminiferal molecular operational taxonomic units that have potential to be used as bioindicator taxa. our results show that metabarcoding represents an effective tool for assessing foraminiferal communities near offshore oil and gas platforms, and that it can be used to complement current monitoring techniques.

"693",NA,"estimating species richness using environmental dna","the foundation for any ecological study and for the effective management of biodiversity in natural systems requires knowing what species are present in an ecosystem. we assessed fish communities in a stream using two methods, depletion-based electrofishing and environmental dna metabarcoding (edna) from water samples, to test the hypothesis that edna provides an alternative means of determining species richness and species identities for a natural ecosystem. in a northern indiana stream, electrofishing yielded a direct estimate of 12 species and a mean estimated richness (chao ii estimator) of 16.6 species with a 95% confidence interval from 12.8 to 42.2. edna sampling detected an additional four species, congruent with the mean chao ii estimate from electrofishing. this increased detection rate for fish species between methods suggests that edna sampling can enhance estimation of fish fauna in flowing waters while having minimal sampling impacts on fish and their habitat. modern genetic approaches therefore have the potential to transform our ability to build a more complete list of species for ecological investigations and inform management of aquatic ecosystems.",2016

"733",NA,"please mind the gap visual census and cryptic biodiversity assessment at central red sea coral reefs","coral reefs harbor the most diverse assemblages in the ocean, however, a large proportion of the diversity is cryptic and, therefore, undetected by standard visual census techniques. cryptic and exposed communities differ considerably in species composition and ecological function. this study compares three different coral reef assessment protocols: i) visual benthic reef surveys: ii) visual census of autonomous reef monitoring structures (arms) plates; and iii) metabarcoding techniques of the arms (including sessile, 106-500â î¼m and 500-2000â î¼m size fractions), that target the cryptic and exposed communities of three reefs in the central red sea. visual census showed a dominance of cnidaria (anthozoa) and rhodophyta on the reef substrate, while porifera, bryozoa and rhodophyta were the most abundant groups on the arms plates. metabarcoding, targeting the 18s rrna gene, significantly increased estimates of the species diversity (pâ <â 0.001); revealing that annelida were generally the dominant phyla (in terms of reads) of all fractions and reefs. furthermore, metabarcoding detected microbial eukaryotic groups such as syndiniophyceae, mamiellophyceae and bacillariophyceae as relevant components of the sessile fraction. anosim analysis showed that the three reef sites showed no differences based on the visual census data. metabarcoding showed a higher sensitivity for identifying differences between reef communities at smaller geographic scales than standard visual census techniques as significant differences in the assemblages were observed amongst the reefs. comparison of the techniques showed no similar patterns for the visual techniques while the metabarcoding of the arms showed similar patterns amongst fractions. establishing arms as a standard tool in reef monitoring will not only advance our understanding of local processes and ecological community response to environmental changes, as different faunal components will provide complementary information but also improve the estimates of biodiversity in coral reef benthic communities. this study lays the foundations for further studies looking at integrating traditional reef survey methodologies with complementary approaches, such as metabarcoding, which investigate other components of the reef community.

'macrobial' biologists and ecologists--those accustomed to dealing with species they can see and count--have been slower to adopt such molecular survey techniques, in part because of the uncertain relationship between the number of recovered dna sequences and the abundance of whole organisms in the sampled environment. in this issue of molecular ecology resources, evans et al.

"833",NA,"stability of the gorilla microbiome despite simian immunodeficiency virus infection","simian immunodeficiency viruses (sivs) have been discovered in over 45 primate species; however, the pathogenic potential of most siv strains remains unknown due to difficulties inherent in observing wild populations. because those siv infections that are pathogenic have been shown to induce changes in the host's gut microbiome, monitoring the microbiota present in faecal samples can provide a noninvasive means for studying the effects of siv infection on the health of wild-living primates. here, we examine the effects of sivgor, a close relative of sivcpz of chimpanzees and hiv-1 of humans, on the gut bacterial communities residing within wild gorillas, revealing that gorilla gut microbiomes are exceptionally robust to siv infection. in contrast to the microbiomes of hiv-1-infected humans and sivcpz-infected chimpanzees, sivgor-infected gorilla microbiomes exhibit neither rises in the frequencies of opportunistic pathogens nor elevated rates of microbial turnover within individual hosts. regardless of siv infection status, gorilla microbiomes assort into enterotypes, one of which is compositionally analogous to those identified in humans and chimpanzees. the other gorilla enterotype appears specialized for a leaf-based diet and is enriched in environmentally derived bacterial genera. we hypothesize that the acquisition of this gorilla-specific enterotype was enabled by lowered immune system control over the composition of the microbiome. our results indicate differences between the pathology of sivgor and sivcpz/hiv-1 infections, demonstrating the utility of investigating host microbial ecology as a means for studying disease in wild primates of high conservation priority.

"834",NA,"vertical distribution of the soil microbiota along a successional gradient in a glacier forefield","spatial patterns of microbial communities have been extensively surveyed in well-developed soils, but few studies investigated the vertical distribution of micro-organisms in newly developed soils after glacier retreat. we used 454-pyrosequencing to assess whether bacterial and fungal community structures differed between stages of soil development (ssd) characterized by an increasing vegetation cover from barren (vegetation cover: 0%/age: 10 years), sparsely vegetated (13%/60 years), transient (60%/80 years) to vegetated (95%/110 years) and depths (surface, 5 and 20 cm) along the damma glacier forefield (switzerland). the ssd significantly influenced the bacterial and fungal communities. based on indicator species analyses, metabolically versatile bacteria (e.g. geobacter) and psychrophilic yeasts (e.g. mrakia) characterized the barren soils. vegetated soils with higher c, n and root biomass consisted of bacteria able to degrade complex organic compounds (e.g. candidatus solibacter), lignocellulolytic ascomycota (e.g. geoglossum) and ectomycorrhizal basidiomycota (e.g. laccaria). soil depth only influenced bacterial and fungal communities in barren and sparsely vegetated soils. these changes were partly due to more silt and higher soil moisture in the surface. in both soil ages, the surface was characterized by otus affiliated to phormidium and sphingobacteriales. in lower depths, however, bacterial and fungal communities differed between ssd. lower depths of sparsely vegetated soils consisted of otus affiliated to acidobacteria and geoglossum, whereas depths of barren soils were characterized by otus related to gemmatimonadetes. overall, plant establishment drives the soil microbiota along the successional gradient but does not influence the vertical distribution of microbiota in recently deglaciated soils.",2015
"835",NA,"universal and blocking primer mismatches limit the use of high throughput dna sequencing for the quantitative metabarcoding of arthropods","the quantification of the biological diversity in environmental samples using high-throughput dna sequencing is hindered by the pcr bias caused by variable primer-template mismatches of the individual species. in some dietary studies, there is the added problem that samples are enriched with predator dna, so often a predator-specific blocking oligonucleotide is used to alleviate the problem. however, specific blocking oligonucleotides could coblock nontarget species to some degree. here, we accurately estimate the extent of the pcr biases induced by universal and blocking primers on a mock community prepared with dna of twelve species of terrestrial arthropods. we also compare universal and blocking primer biases with those induced by variable annealing temperature and number of pcr cycles. the results show that reads of all species were recovered after pcr enrichment at our control conditions (no blocking oligonucleotide, 45â â°c annealing temperature and 40 cycles) and high-throughput sequencing. they also show that the four factors considered biased the final proportions of the species to some degree. among these factors, the number of primer-template mismatches of each species had a disproportionate effect (up to five orders of magnitude) on the amplification efficiency. in particular, the number of primer-template mismatches explained most of the variation (~3/4) in the amplification efficiency of the species. the effect of blocking oligonucleotide concentration on nontarget species relative abundance was also significant, but less important (below one order of magnitude). considering the results reported here, the quantitative potential of the technique is limited, and only qualitative results (the species list) are reliable, at least when targeting the barcoding coi region.

"863",NA,"environmental metabarcodes for insects in silico pcr reveals potential for taxonomic bias","studies of insect assemblages are suited to the simultaneous dna-based identification of multiple taxa known as metabarcoding. to obtain accurate estimates of diversity, metabarcoding markers ideally possess appropriate taxonomic coverage to avoid pcr-amplification bias, as well as sufficient sequence divergence to resolve species. we used in silico pcr to compare the taxonomic coverage and resolution of newly designed insect metabarcodes (targeting 16s) with that of existing markers [16s and cytochrome oxidase c subunit i (coi)] and then compared their efficiency in vitro. existing metabarcoding primers amplified in silico <75% of insect species with complete mitochondrial genomes available, whereas new primers targeting 16s provided >90% coverage. furthermore, metabarcodes targeting coi appeared to introduce taxonomic pcr-amplification bias, typically amplifying a greater percentage of lepidoptera and diptera species, while failing to amplify certain orders in silico. to test whether bias predicted in silico was observed in vitro, we created an artificial dna blend containing equal amounts of dna from 14 species, representing 11 insect orders and one arachnid. we pcr-amplified the blend using five primer sets, targeting either coi or 16s, with high-throughput amplicon sequencing yielding more than 6 million reads. in vitro results typically corresponded to in silico pcr predictions, with newly designed 16s primers detecting 11 insect taxa present, thus providing equivalent or better taxonomic coverage than coi metabarcodes. our results demonstrate that in silico pcr is a useful tool for predicting taxonomic bias in mixed template pcr and that researchers should be wary of potential bias when selecting metabarcoding markers.",2014

"882",NA,"a dna metabarcoding study of a primate dietary diversity and plasticity across its entire fragmented range","in tropical regions, most primary ecosystems have been replaced by mosaic landscapes in which species must cope with a large shift in the distribution of their habitat and associated food resources. primates are particularly vulnerable to habitat modifications. most species persist in small fragments surrounded by complex human-mediated matrices whose structure and connectivity may strongly influence their dispersal and feeding behavior. behavioral plasticity appears to be a crucial parameter governing the ability of organisms to exploit the resources offered by new matrix habitats and thus to persist in fragmented habitats. in this study, we were interested in the dietary plasticity of the golden-crowned sifaka (propithecus tattersalli), an endangered species of lemur, found only in the daraina region in north-eastern madagascar. we used a dna-based approach combining the barcoding concept and illumina next-generation sequencing to (i) describe the species diet across its entire range and (ii) evaluate the influence of landscape heterogeneity on diet diversity and composition. faeces from 96 individuals were sampled across the entire species range and their contents were analyzed using the trnl metabarcoding approach. in parallel, we built a large dna reference database based on a checklist of the plant species of the daraina region. our results suggest that golden-crowned sifakas exhibit remarkable dietary diversity with at least 130 plant species belonging to 80 genera and 49 different families. we highlighted an influence of both habitat type and openness on diet composition suggesting a high flexibility of foraging strategies. moreover, we observed the presence of numerous cultivated and naturalized plants in the faeces of groups living in forest edge areas. overall, our findings support our initial expectation that p. tattersalli is able to cope with the current level of alteration of the landscape and confirm our previous results on the distribution and the dispersal ability of this species.",2013
