# Prospects and challenges of implementing DNA metabarcoding for high-throughput insect surveillance

This repository hosts the R based reproducible workflow that performed the analyses presented for the manuscript *Prospects and Challenges of implementing DNA metabarcoding for High-Throughput Surveillance of Trapped insects* by Alexander M. Piper, Jana Batovska, Noel O.I. Cogan, John Weiss, John Paul Cunningham, Brendan C. Rodoni and Mark J. Blacket

Rmarkdown documents to conduct the download relevant data from SCOPUS, NCBI and BOLD and conduct anaylsis are contained in the root directory. Raw data files including .gb and .fasta files are zipped for size reasons. These will need to be unzipped to allow for analysis. CSV files holding intermediate data objects suitable for performing the analyses and creating figures are contained the individual data directorys, and these can be used to plot the figures without having to unzip and process the raw data files.

The Rmarkdown document has also been rendered into html format, and can be viewed in your web browser:
